Two linked datasets, A with data on nodes and B with data on edges.

Some views of A will drawn with edges; that's unlikely for B.  The
edges in A are linked to points in B.

B is the graph complement of A, so it's mathematically meaningful
link an edge in B to a point in A, but that is unlikely to be
meaningful in terms of the data.

  since in fact edges will not be drawn in plots of this
