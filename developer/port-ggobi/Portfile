long_description  GGobi is an open source visualization program for exploring \
                  high-dimensional data. It provides highly dynamic and interactive \
                  graphics such as tours, as well as familiar graphics such as \
                  the scatterplot, barchart and parallel coordinates plots. Plots \
                  are interactive and linked with brushing and identification.
