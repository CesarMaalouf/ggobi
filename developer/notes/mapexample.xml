  There are two main elements in this file:

  * one polygondata element, which defines the polygons for the map.
    It contains two main sub-elements:
      * polypoints: the nodes for the polygons, each tagged with an id
      * polygons: the polygons, referencing the polypoint ids

    This element is read by the plugin and ignored by ggobi.

  * one ggobi data element, containing data corresponding
    to the polygons in the map.  This element is read by ggobi,
    so it isn't read by the plugin.

  There are two ways to define the nodes for polygons:  when they're
  defined as they are here, in the polygon data element, the points
  are not sensitive to brushing and identification and can not be
  plotted.  That makes sense for maps.

  In other cases, the polydata element will not have any 
  points, and the polygons will be defined in terms of points
  that exist in some ggobi data element.  (see polyexample.xml)

  These two cases may in practice be represented by entirely
  different plugins, come to think of it, but we can still come up
  with a consistent way of defining them.

  polypoints must always specify an id so they can be used to define
  polygons.

  polypoints usually live in 2D, but they may occasionally live in
  higher-dimensional spaces.  We can use 'variables' or 'dimensions'
  to describe the dimensions of that space.

  polygons may be nested, and because of that, they may need
  more than one categorical variable:  eg, a polygon may exist
  as a county by itself, or as one of a collection of counties
  that make up a state.
