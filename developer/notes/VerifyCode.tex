\section{}

From the \file{pluginViewer.c}
file in \dir{pluginManager}, we have
\begin{verbatim}
gboolean
onLoadPluginManager(gboolean init, GGobiPluginInfo *plugin)
{
  gboolean ok;
  ok = checkGGobiStructSizes();
  if(!ok) {
     g_printerr("Plugin %s (in %s) needs to be recompiled\n", plugin->details->name, plugin->details->dllName);
  }

  return(ok);
}
\end{verbatim}

In R, we have an S function that calls the relevant C interfaces to
the struct information from the \Spackage{Rggobi} package and the
\SharedLibrary{libggobi} and then compares their contents in the S
language for simplicity.  This function is called automatically when
the library is loaded.


\section{Event Callbacks}
If one compiles with \CppMacro{CHECK_EVENT_SIGNATURES} defined as a
pre-processor symbol (set \MakeVariable{DEFINES} in
\file{local.config} to \texttt{-DCHECK_EVENT_SIGNATURES=1}),
additional code is compiled that checks the different callback
functions currently in use in GGobi for GGobi-generated (i.e. not Gtk
widget generated) events.
When one adds a callback, please add
a line in the file scope to test the routine.
\begin{verbatim}
 CHECK_EVENT_SIGNATURE(myRoutine, event_name_f)
\end{verbatim}
For example 
\begin{verbatim}
CHECK_EVENT_SIGNATURE(exclusion_notebook_adddata_cb, datad_added_f)
\end{verbatim}
in \file{exclusion_ui.c} checks that the C routine
\Croutine{exclusion_notebook_adddata_cb} is defined appropriately for
the \texttt{datad_added} signals.  This should be done in plugins,
etc.  and will give some warning when compiled with maximum warning
levels on for the compiler (e.g -Wall in gcc).

Rather than adding the test, one can also just simply cast the routine
address in the callback to the target type as given in GGobiEvents.h.
