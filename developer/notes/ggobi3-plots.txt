Plots ------------------------------------------------------------------------

A plot combines all the pieces to make a GGobi plot.  Each plot is composed of:

  * a set of layers (one of which is active), each having
    * link to the pipeline (generally through stage-flatten)
    * set of interaction modes (one of which is active)
    * a geom
  * a canvas/surface
  * guides (e.g. tour axis, variable circles, axis labels)
  * a gui

Existing types
  * 1d point (dot plot)
  * 1d area (histogram/bar chart)
  * 2d point (scatterplot)
  * nd area (mosaic plot)
  * parallel coordinates plot
  * matrix 
  * time series


Interaction modes ------------------------------------------------------------

An interaction mode turns plot events into data events.  It:

  * modifies properties of plot components
  * receives events from the the plot canvas
  * has layer(s) for visual representation 
  
An interaction mode can either be active or inactive.  Only a single interaction mode is active at a time (GGobi-wide).  

Existing modes:
  * brush: changes colour, size and shape attributes
  * identify: changes sticky label attribute; displays text on screen
  * pan/zoom: changes viewport properties of canvas
  * edit points/edges: changes data 
  * manual tour controls: changes projection matrix in stage-project

New modes:
  * axis identify: draws on screen

Interaction modes should have as little optimisation as possible - most of the complex data structures should be wrapped in convenient interfaces elsewhere.  Needs to be easy to experiment with new interaction types. 

Geom -------------------------------------------------------------------------

A geom (geometric element) is responsible for turning data into a visual representation, and mapping from locations in the data space to observations (rows in the data matrix).

Existing geoms:
  * points
  * segments
  * bars
New geoms:
  * lines
  * polygons
