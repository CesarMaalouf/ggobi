  There are three main elements in this file:

  * one data element which defines the nodes of the polygon.
    Since they live in a datad, they can be plotted and brushed
    and so forth.  They must have ids.

  * one polygon data element

  * another data element, with covariates corresponding to 
    each polygon.

  How will the polygon viewer know which variables from the data
  element to use in constructing the polygons?  By default, it will
  use the first two variables; it will be possible to choose other
  variables or more variables.

  A thought:  I wonder if this would allow us to explore Georgia
  Thompson's ranking data?  Perhaps we don't even need it, because we
  could do everything useful with points and edges along, but it
  would allow us to have data on the polygons themselves, which 
  we can't do otherwise.

<data name="polygon nodes">
<description>
  The points that define the nodes of the polygons.  Let's suppose
  these are 3d polygons and there are no additional variables on the
  nodes.  These points are required to have ids.

<!-- the polygon data, using the points from the preceding data element -->

<polygondata name="Assorted polygons">
<description>
  The polygons themselves, using the ids defined in the
  preceding data element. 

  The polypoints element is null.  As a result, the default for
  drawing the polygons is this:  they will be drawn using the first
  two variables of the first datad.  Other variables can be specified.

  I was going to say that other datad's can be specified, but that
  isn't really true because id's are unique within a single xml file,
  so the points can only be specified in one datad.

  Let's suppose we have no variables on the polygons, though
  we could have.

  Notice that there are no polypoints.
