Strategy:

Since there will be so many styles of variable indicators, these
should be created and destroyed on the fly, I fear.  No widgets
below the paned should be part of the datad.  Is that possible?
Otherwise I create all the pointers but destroy the widgets and
free the pixmaps when they're not displayed, keeping only the
vars_p arrays.

Let's see how many widgets and other variables I'm working with:
