12020   3/12   finalizing the parallel coordinates plot layout & selection
12240   3/13   scatterplot matrix, first pass
12604   3/14   scatterplot matrix, nearly finished with selection
12734   3/15   scatterplot matrix, finishing selection
13079   3/17   reworked splot_new, display_new; basic id works, no linking
13218   3/20   linked identification works; drawing uses 2 pixmaps
14359   3/22   point brushing, no linking, no plot_bins yet
14525   3/24   linked point brushing and binning
14870   3/24   beginning of lines code; cleaned up display menus
15276   3/27   more lines code; about ready to draw in scatterplot/scatmat
15312   3/27   basic line drawing; initial color isn't right
15079   3/28   simplification of drawing code!
15177   3/28   parallel coordinates lines are working -- even linked brushing!
15295   3/28   variable cloning!
15323   3/30   variable table, can select rows, sort by a col; cloning ok
16001   4/3    slowly reconstructing transformation; getting close
17599   4/4    basic transformation; no labels; mygtkruler files (1480 lines)
18147   4/5    restored batch drawing code for win32; updated gtkruler files
18271   4/7    eliminated inv_transform; adding jittering, RANK, NORMSCORE
18391   4/7    working on the handling of missings; dumping core at present
18405   4/8    cleaned up win32 drawing; more on missings; float sort in table
18668   4/9    scaling a la xgobi works; so does click to pan
18713   4/9    scaling visual aids nearly finished
18723   4/11   scaling is finished, even the axes
18852   4/12   using jitter by jitter for 1d missings plots
19041   4/17   missing/jittering/vartable interactions improving; queue_draw
19139   4/17   reads .missing; improved layout geometry for varpanel/table
18742   4/18   some cleanup and debugging
18669   4/18   can't use queue_draw; too slow
18750   4/20   some cleanup of groups in transformation; parcoords whiskers
18602   4/20   created externs.h
18543   4/20   simplified transformations: always 1 variable at a time
18610   4/20   handling "show missings" for scatmat/parcoords displays
18731   4/20   making the variable menus work
18790   4/21   using queue_draw in configure_cb, forcing it elsewhere
19089   4/21   the basics of subsetting 
19255   4/24   the basics of the sphering ui
20508   5/2     sphering completed; can start ggobi w/o
                file; 'glyph size only' brushing; adv tour in a notebook;
                display_tree (Duncan) 
20555   5/2     beginning to add API routines; starting with brushing

my personal target:  about 40.8K lines?  That's the number of lines in
xgobi, subtracting the rpc, xgvis and tour code.
