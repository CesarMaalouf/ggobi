<li> Decide whether to create displays for the different types
that don't really need to be done that way but just cleaner.
i.e. barchart display, time series.
    Instead, we can use an a slot in the GtkGGobiExtendDisplay
    instance (not class) to provide data for some of the things
    that are specific to the instance but for which we don't
    want to define an entire class.


<dl>
  <dt> the tsplot_... in cpaneld ?
  <dd>
      Seems like it should go into the display.
      Then when the display is re-activated, it can restore
      its view of the world.

  <dt> newTimeSeries in ggobi-API.c seems to do 2 display creations
      and discards one.
  <dd>

  <dt> What is `<code>tsplot</code>' struct entry in ggobid for accelerators. See ggobi.h
  <dd>
      Removed for Barchart. barchart_mode_menu_make() now returns the
      menu widget it created rather than passes it indirectly.
      Time series actually uses it!

  <dt> Is display_create being used anywhere. Yes, in the
       callback for creating a display.
       However, we now also use the extended_display_open_cb()
       to handle an extended type.
      Make certain these are kept in synch.
  <dd>

  <dt> display_tree.c
  <dd>
     The time series names should contain the two variables
      i.e. the X and Y variables. Perhaps put this in the
      top-most node for the plot.
      <br>
      This is nothing to do with the class system.



  <dt> splot_free

  <dd> Handle the destroy methods correctly.

  <dt> Split the splot hierarcy into 1d and 2d and move some of the
      variables
      into different classes.
  <dd>
      pmid p1dvar, etc.
      <br>
      And the tour should be split.
      Also, cpaneld looks like some of it is not needed for all displays.

  <dt> display.c computeTitle() needs to determine the title
      for the display type, but needs to
      do it from the type of plots it is displaying.
  <dd>

  <dt> Free the ExtendedDisplayCreateData objects when destroying the menus.
  <dd>

  <dt> Options menu in viewmode_submenus_update.
      Depends on the viewmode, not the display type.
      So have to figure something out to allow the
      display to do something.
  <dd>
     Add display type to OpModeNames.
     Perhaps add these dynamically to another list
     and recognize that it is special.
      <br>
      Not needed.

  <dt>
    Test the deletion of variables and see if the plotted() routine
      still works.
      
  <dd> Is this used except in scatterplots?
      When is sphering used?
      <br>
      The delete_vars callbacks are not in effect.
      Will they be re-activated?

  <dt>XXX   Finish the barchart destroy method.
  <dd>

  <dt> submenu_destroy (gg->viewmode_item);
        in display_set_current() is causing error messages.
  <dd>
     Works now.

  <dt> Switching modes doesn't update the
      control panel contents, just the frame title.
  <dd> Look at viewmode_set.
      <br>
     Working now that we have current_control_panel in the ggobid.

  <dt> Do we need to provide a query for an extended display
      allowing the addition of plot labels in
       <code> splot_add_plot_labels</code> in sp_plot.c
  <dd>
</dl>


<h2>Removing <code>tsplot</code></h2>

<ul>
  <li> display_set_values shouldn't take a display type but a GtkType
      or something.
      see barchart_new in barchart.c 
  <li> display_alloc_init() takes a display type.
 newTimeSeries in ggobi-API.c
  <li> splot_alloc() uses the display type in a switch.
  <li> splot_free() uses a switch on the display type.
       Make certain the destroy methods are working.
  <li> splot_world_to_plane
  <li> splot_plane_to_screen

  <li> splot_plot_edge
  <li> splot_plot_case
  <li> splot_add_plot_labels
  <li> splot_draw_to_pixmap0_binned handles tsplot segment drawing.
      and  splot_draw_to_pixmap0_unbinned.


  <li> getDisplayType in XML read_init. Needs to use the Gtk type
      name.
  <li> createDisplayFromDescription needs to handle extended types.
</ul>




<dl>
  <dt> display.c
  <dd>
       display_tailpipe &amp;
      display_type_handles_action


</dl>


<h3>Fixed</h3>
<dl>

  <dt> display_tree.c
  <dd>
           Get the tsplot_tree_label routine registered for the appropriate
      method.
      
      <ul>
	<li> Remove other basic plots from display_tree_label. Ok for now.
	<li> Handle the splot's in splot_tree_label. Okay!
	<li> Get the names for the time series. (what names?) of the variables!
      </ul>

    
  <dt> Options menu on the control panel window is being repeated
      each time we switch to an extended display.
  <dd> Fixed.
      Pass the displayd of interest to mode_has_options_menu.
       Otherwise, doesn't know that there is one there already.
      This means computing the old display in higher level routines
      and passing it down.

  <dt> Add support for extended display modes in mode_has_options_menu.
  <dd>

  <dt> Set up the control panel for the extended display types.
  <dd> Working. Done on demand.
      Not stored in ggobi's array of widgets for panels.
  <dt> set_color_id looks at class of splot to see if Barchart
      to do a full redraw.
  <dd> See a class-specific field to indicate what level of redraw to
      do.
      <br>
       Done with the redraw field in the class.

  <dt> Lines on the time series
  <dd> Done.

</dl>
