GGobi makes extensive use of XML and inputs provided in the XML
format, while still maintaining supporting for the older input style
used in xgobi.  This use of XML, and specifically the parser provided
as part of the <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">libxml</a>
distribution, increases the dependencies on other software that must
be available to install and run GGobi.  Because there are many
different versions of <b>libxml</b>, some installed on the system and
others installed by individual users, matching the correct version of
GGobi with the correct version of <b>libxml</b> with both at
configuration- and run-time becomes very complex.  Our approach
intends to err on the side of simplicity rather than maximal
flexibility.

<p>
We have made two versions of the GGobi source
available:
<a href="http://www.ggobi.org/Download/ggobi.tar.gz">ggobi.tar.gz</a>
and
<a href="http://www.ggobi.org/Download/ggobi-xml.tar.gz">ggobi-xml.tar.gz</a>.
The difference between these is that the second (ggobi-xml.tar.gz)
contains an unaltered version of a libxml distribution
that is known to work with GGobi.
If you already have libxml (version 2)
available on your machine, you can download
<a href="http://www.ggobi.org/Download/ggobi.tar.gz">ggobi.tar.gz</a>
which is (currently) half the size of
<a
href="http://www.ggogi.org/Download/ggobi-xml.tar.gz">ggobi-xml.tar.gz</a>.
If you have an incompatible version of libxml, or
cannot install <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">libxml</a>
on the system, it will probably be simplest to download
<a
href="http://www.ggogi.org/Download/ggobi-xml.tar.gz">ggobi-xml.tar.gz</a>
and have the GGobi installation build the contained libxml
distribution.
<p>
In either case, one builds GGobi with XML support
with the commands
<pre>
  ./configure --with-xml   <i>[any other configuration arguments]</i>
  make
</pre>


<p>

We strongly suggest that you perform a complete installation of <a
href="http://www.xmlsoft.org">libxml, version 2</a> onto your system
before compiling the GGobi distribution.
(A version of libxml known to work with GGobi is available
with in the <a
href="http://www.ggobi.org/Download/ggobi-xml.tar.gz">(bigger) tar
file</a>.)
This will make libxml available to all users of the system
in a standard location.
To do this you will need <i>root</i> access
for your machine, or need to ask your system administrator to do it
for you.  The steps are simple.
<ol>
  <li> Download libxml
  <li> configure the distribution for the build: use the command
<pre>
     ./configure 
</pre>
If you want it to be installed in a non-default
 directory, use a command such as
<pre>
   ./configure --prefix=/whatever/directory/it/should/go/in
</pre>
  <li> Build the library
<pre>
  make
</pre>      
  <li> Install the executables, libraries, etc.
      into the system area where others can access them.
<pre>
  make install
</pre>
</ol>

At this point, the GGobi configuration script will be able to find the
information it needs about the libxml installation and will succeed in
working. It uses the executable <b>xml2-config</b> (created during the
<code>make install</code> part of the libxml installation) to get this
information, and the directory in which this is installed (the
<code>bin/</code> directory) should be in your path when configuring
GGobi.

<p>

Given the installed XML library, one builds the GGobi
distribution by changing to the
<code>ggobi/</code> directory
and issuing the command
<pre>
 ./configure --with-xml
</pre>
