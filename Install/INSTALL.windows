We use Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org) by Jordan Russell to
create a self-installing executable for ggobi.  This handles
installing the relevant files (the executable and 3rd party DLLs),
example data files, and adding ggobi to the user's Start->Programs
menu and optionally creating an icon on their desktop.

One uses the Inno Setup compiler to create the self-extracting and
installing executable. To do this, you need to have version 2.0.9 (or
higher) of Inno Setup installed. Then, run Inno Setup Compiler and
open the file Install/ggobi.iss in the ggobi/ source.  To compile the
installation information, you must have compiled ggobi.exe and have
the necessary 3rd party DLLs available. I have put the latter in a
single directory named libs/ on my machine.

When the user downloads and runs this executable, they are presented
with a sequence of dialog screens.

It starts by notifying the user that this will install ggobi and asks
whether she would like to continue? We expect the user to click Yes
and proceed to the first page of the ggobi setup program.  The user
probably doesn't need to close other applications, as is suggested in
the spash screen.  Clicking the Next button brings them to the license
page. This shows them the AT&T license. They should read this and
accept it by clicking on the Yes button.  Accepting the license brings
them to the page which allows them to specify where on the disk they
want ggobi installed. The setup program will suggest putting it in the
ggobi folder within the Program Files folder. This is fine, but the
user can set any directory she wishes. She can select another
directory by clicking on the different folders to navigate the file
system or move to a different disk/partition using the
options/pull-down menu at the bottom of this dialog page.
Alternatively, she can type the fully qualified directory name in the
text field at the top of the page.

Having selected the target directory in which ggobi is installed, the
next page asks where to put the shortcuts for ggobi. These are menu
items in the desktop's Start->Programs menu. Usually one accepts the
default settings which will create a separate ggobi entry in this
menu. This ggobi menu will contain entries for launching ggobi,
browsing the ggobi Web site and uninstalling ggobi.  If one doesn't
want these menu items, click on the checkbox at the bottom of the page
(Don't create a Start Menu Folder).

Moving to the next page allows the user to specify whether they want
an icon for ggobi on their desktop. By default, we create this.  The
user can uncheck the checkbox on this page to avoid creating this
desktop shortcut for ggobi.

And finally we come to the last page before the installation actually
occurs.  This gives a summary of the settings to which the user has
agreed. Confirm these and proceed with the installation by clicking on
the Install button. To modify these, use the Back button to return to
the appropriate page for changing the incorrect setting.

Assuming all went well, the installation concludes with a page that
announces success and also allows the user run ggobi.  If the checkbox
'Launch ggobi' is checked when the user clicks on the Finish button
(or hits return), ggobi will be executed. It will start in the
