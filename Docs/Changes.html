<h1></h1>

This file gives a list of the changes for each of the "versions" of
GGobi. It is organized in reverse order so that the most recent
releases are We hope to keep it as up-to-date as possible, but we
often forget.


<h2>1.1-2</h2>
<dl>

  <dt> Configuration file for use with pkg-config for ggobi
  <dd> pkg-config --cflags ggobi, etc. works  include
        pkg-config --variable=Home ggobi
  
  <dt> Added the missing CMD for R CMD INSTALL Rggobi.
  <dd>
  
  <dt> Install Rggobi if the Rggobi directory is present.
  <dd> To override this, use ./configure --with-R=no
</dl>



<h2>1.0.0</h2>
<dl>

 <dt>
 <li> Color schemes now read by default, from the file data/colorschemes.xml
 <dd>
  
 <dt>
   We use an explicit ggobiHome in the Session options
  to identify the location of the GGobi "installation".
 <dd>
    

 <dt> On Windows, GGobi is added to the registry in 
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\GGobi
  and has the key <i>Home</i> giving the location in which 
  it is installed.
 <dd>
  This is used to find GGobi files (e.g. ggobirc, plugins), especially 
  when GGobi is embedded in other applications and the location
  cannot be computed from the name of the running application.
</dl>


<h2></h2>
 <dl>
 <dt> ExcelReader plugin for reading data directly from Excel.
 <dd>
 </dl>



<h2></h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Configuration now tries -shared and if that fails -G
      as the flag for creating a shared library..
  <dd> This should help things on Solaris with a GCC that wants -G.
</dl>

<h2></h2>
<dl>
  <dt> <code>--plugin=fileName</code> allows one to specify individual
      plugin.xml files directly on the command line

  <dd> This is useful for debugging, etc. without having to edit
      the ggobirc file to add or remove plugin entries.
      
  <dt> Major internal changes of the data structures making them
      use the Gtk class system and now using reflectance.
  <dd>
  <dt> restore argument allows one to restore a collection
      of plots for a given ggobi from a previous session.
      
  <dd> <code>--restore=file</code> and <code>-restore file</code>

  <dt> Selecting a display in the Display Tree now raises the
      window to the foreground.
  <dd>

  <dt> Events are defined on ggobid, datad structures rather than
       the associated widgets/windows. 
  <dd> Plugins may need to be updated.
</dl>


<h2>Version 0.99-1</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Support for new XML data format in which values are specified by
       a &lt;real&gt; or &lt;int&gt; element within a &lt;record&gt;.
       Missing values are represented by the element &lt;na/&gt;.
      
  <dd> The old format in which the values are given as a simple string
      within the version is also supported.

  <dt> Specifying the active color scheme within a data file.

  <dd> Support for specifying the colors cheme within a data file
       to apply to the given GGobi instance using &lt;activecolorscheme&gt;.
      One can use a <b>name</b> attribute to identify the scheme by name
      from with the available schemes. Additionally one can use
      <b>file</b> to specify the name of an XML file containing color schemes to be read
      and added to those available to the GGobi instance.  This file
      is read before the <b>name</b> is used to resolve the
      colorscheme.

      <br>
      In the future, we will allow the color scheme to be in-lined
      within the file.

  <dt> The Color Schemes tool uses a tree to display the
       different color schemes, grouped by type.
  <dd>
      
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.99</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Perl language plugin allowing one to write
       general and input plugins in Perl.
  <dd>
  <dt> Redesigned the way missings are viewed: instead of
       creating special 'missings' displays, we create a
       new dataset and link it to the original dataset.
  <dd>
  <dt> Implemented rescaling in response to dragging in the
       scatterplot axes.
  <dd>
  <dt> 1D plots: implemented cycling, added an option to
       add line segments to ASHes.  (Added that same option
       to the 1D tour, too.)
  <dd>
  <dt> Variable selection panel: switched from a single checkbutton
       to two togglebuttons and a button.  We hope this is a
       simpler interface for new users to figure out.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.98</h2>
<dl>
  <dt> Integrated the use of so-called colorschemes throughout
       the code; the initial scheme can be defined on the command
       line like this: --activeColorScheme="schemename" 
  <dd>
  <dt> Support for bidirectional edges:  if an edge is drawn from
       a to b and from b to a, then draw half of the edge at a time.
       In that way, each edge can be a different width or color.
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.92.0</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> A variable within a dataset can be used as the labels
      for the records.
      <i>&lt;realvariable&gt;</i> and
      <i>&lt;categoricalvariable&gt;</i>
      support <b>recordLabel</b>.
      
  <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.9.6</h2>
<dl>

  <dt><li> Additions to the preferences specifiable in an
       initialization file.
      <br>
     &lt;autoplot&gt;, &lt;allowNoDisplays&gt;,
      &lt;quitOnLastGGobi&gt;
     Each has a <b>on</b> attribute
      that can be a logical value
      (TRUE, true, True, T, 1 or
       FALSE, False, false, F, 0)
      <br>
      Also, &lt;numDefaultPlotVars&gt;
      sets the default number of variables to display
      in the different plots.
      <br>
      &lt;sessionFile&gt; gives the name
      to which the session is saved.

      <dl>
        <dt><li>&lt;autoplot on="true|false"&gt;
        <dd> controls whether the initial scatterplot is
            created and displayed for a newly created
            GGobi instance with data.
	<dt><li>&lt;allowNoDisplays&gt;
	 <dd> controls whether one can close the last
	     display for a GGobi instance and therefore
	     have no plots displayed, but only the
	     main GGobi window for that instance.
	 <dt><li> &lt;quitOnLastGGobi&gt;
	 <dd> controls whether closing the last remaining
	     GGobi instance main window terminates the GGobi session.
	 <dt><li> &lt;numDefaultPlotVars&gt;
	 <dd>
          The attributes are <b>scatmat</b>, <b>parcoords</b>.
	  The value for each gives the default number of variables to
          display in the display. If this is negative, all variables are used.

	 <dt><li> &lt;sessionFile&gt;
	 <dd> The attributes are <b>name</b>
	      which gives the name of the file to which to write the
	     session information, and
	     <b>compress</b> which is a non-negative integer value
	     specifying the compression level. Since the file
	     is short, 0 is a suitable value to allow the file
	     to be read as regular text.
       </dl> 
      
  <dd>
  <dt><li>Added an item `Close' to the File menu that closes the 
    particular GGobi instance. 

  <dd>Quit terminates the application.

  <dt><li> Java meta-plugin that allows developers to create
       plugins implemented in Java.
  <dd> Examples in the <code>plugins/JVM</code> directory.

  <dt><li> Extended facilities in the DataViewer plugin
      to link point brushing, identification and movement
      to the cells in the worksheets. Also changes
       made in a cell are updated in the GGobi dataset and plots.
  <dd>

  <dt><li> GGobi plugin for Gnumeric allowing ggobi to be used
      in spreadsheets.
  <dd>

  <dt><li> Database connectivity implemented via plugins for
      Postgres and MySQL.
  <dd>

  <dt><li> Meta plugin using R that allows one to write plugins
      for GGobi using the S language.
  <dd>

  <dt><li> Splash screen has version information.
  <dd>

  <dt><li> Updates for the Tree of displays.
  <dd>
      <dl>
	<dt><li> Updates dynamically to reflect changes in the
	    variables displayed in a  plot.
	<dd>
	<dt><li> Displays the name of the dataset from
 	    associated with the variables in the plot.
	<dd>
	<dt><li> Selecting the node for that display
	    (i.e. one of the top-most nodes)
	    causes the first plot in that display
	    to become active.
	<dd>
      </dl>

  <dt><li> Storing the session queries the user for
      the name of the file to which the
      session information should saved.
  <dd>
  <dt><li> The session information now includes all ggobis, the
      preferences, input sources (i.e. files, URIs, etc.) visited, etc.
