<h1>Embedding ggobi FAQ</h1>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li><i class="question"> What are the basic steps in embedding ggobi into another
      application?</i>
  <dd>
      Well, you first have to write code to initialize the ggobi
      engine and then compile it and link against the ggobi library.
      First you want to call the <pre>GGOBI(main)();</pre>
      routine to create a ggobi instance and optionally pass it command line
      arguments to initialize it with the appropriate state.
      Next, compile the code, make certain to add the directory
      containing <i class="file">GGobiAPI.h</i> to the list
      of directories the pre-processor searches (ie. via the -I flag).
      Finally, link against the ggobi library (add <code>-L&lt;wherever
      libggobi.so is located&gt; -lggobi</code> to the link command).
      Now, to get ggobi to respond to use actions, etc., make certain
       to call <code>gtk_main()</code> at some suitable point
      in your application. Integrating this with your event loop (if
      you have one) can be complex.
  <p>
      Some examples of embedding ggobi in different programming environments
      are provided in the <a href="R.html">R</a>, <a
      href="Perl.html">Perl</a> and
      <a href="Python.html">Python</a> interfaces.
      
  
  <dt>
  <li> In some situations I want to add additional items
       to the menu on the main window of a gobbi instance, i.e. the
      variable panel
       window. How can I do that?
  <dd> You can get access to the menu and all its sub-items
       via the field <i>main_menu_manager</i>
       object in the <i>ggobid</i> structure. This is a reference to a
       <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/GtkUIManager.html"><i>GtkUIManager</i></a>
       object  and one can use it to find the different elements. For
      example, in the Python interface to ggobi, we add a Suspend
      button to the <b>File</b> menu in the following way:
<pre>
  menu = GTK_MENU(gtk_ui_manager_get_widget(gg->main_menu_manager, "/File"));
  suspend = gtk_menu_item_new_with_label ("Suspend");
  gtk_menu_shell_append( GTK_MENU_SHELL(menu), suspend);      
</pre>
       You can use this to get a reference to the different widgets
      in the menu (i.e. menu items, menus and sub-menus, etc.)
      and add, remove and change their characteristics.


  <dt>
  <li> How do I get the compilation and linker flags for ggobi
      so that I can find the header files, libraries etc. when
      compiling
      my own application with GGobi embedded?
  <dd>
      There are two  ways to do this: pkg-config and ggobi-config.
      The preferred way is to use the general pkg-config tool.
      This reuses a well-documented and established application
      that is familiar to many.
      It has a rich feature set relative to what we want,
      allowing standard flags and application-specific variables
      to be queried.
      If pkg-config is not installed on your machine, a home-grown
      version "equivalent" is available in the form of the
      ggobi-config script.  This will gradually be phased out
      or left to decay as pkg-config is a nicer way of doing this.
