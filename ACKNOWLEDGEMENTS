Most of the GGobi code was written by Debby Swayne, Di Cook, Duncan
Temple Lang and Andreas Buja.  Nicholas Lewin-Koh has provided a great
deal of help and wrote the primary version the time series displays.
Heike Hofmann provided the primary version of the barchart displays
while at AT&T and then at Iowa State. Michael Lawrence fully upgraded
the GUI to GTK2.  Hadley Wickham redesigned the web site, helped
with many GUI design improvements and reported many bugs.
