Most of the GGobi code was written by Debby Swayne, Di Cook and Duncan
Temple Lang and Andreas Buja.  Nicholas Lewin-Koh has provided a great
deal of help and wrote the primary version the time series displays.
Heike Hoffman provided the primary version of the barchart displays
while at AT&T and then at Iowa State. Michael Lawrence fully upgraded
the GUI to GTK2.
