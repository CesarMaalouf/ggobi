This plugin is a meta-plugin that provides the R engine within ggobi
and this can be used to implement other plugins using the S
programming language.  Using the RGtk and RGgobi packages, one can
develop quite sophisticated facilities in GGobi using an interpreted
language.

This is similar in spirit to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) plugin.
