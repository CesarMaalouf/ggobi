By default, this plugin knows about a single layout method, an
implementation of a radial layout, in which it lays out the nodes in
concentric circles, with the first node in the list appearing at the
center.

In order to use two more layout methods, pick up the graphviz package
from www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz.  I just (January 16, 2003) tested
the build process using graphviz-current.tar.gz, and it's working well.

The older instructions in this file instructed you to read the
instructions in INSTALL.old, but the default process is now working
very nicely, so you can now follow the instructions in INSTALL:  that
is, just use configure and gmake.

Here are the lines I use in my local.config file under linux:

GRAPHVIZ = 1
GVINC=/usr/local/include/graphviz
GVLIB=/usr/local/lib/graphviz

You can see how those are used in the GNUmakefile.
