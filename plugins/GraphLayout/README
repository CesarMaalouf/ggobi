By default, this plugin knows about a single layout method, an
implementation of a radial layout, in which it lays out the nodes in
concentric circles, with the first node in the list appearing at the
center.

In order to use more layout methods, pick up the graphviz package
from graphviz.org.  Currently (Mar 2006), you must use Version
2.3 which can be obtained here:
