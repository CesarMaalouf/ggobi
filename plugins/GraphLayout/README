By default, this plugin knows about a single layout method, an
implementation of a radial layout, in which it lays out the nodes in
concentric circles, with the first node in the list appearing at the
center.

In order to use two more layout methods, pick up the graphviz package
from www.graphviz.org.  I use the official AT&T release, but I hear
the anonymous cvs release should also be fine.

When you build it, instead of using configure and gmake, follow the
instructions in graphviz/INSTALL.old, which does a better job of
building the libraries we need.

Even so, graphviz was not designed with this usage in mind, and until
the graphviz authors catch up to us, the include files and libraries
you need may end up in a few different directories.  Here's a portion
of a local.config file that works on linux:

GRAPHVIZ = 1
GVIZ_ARCH=linux.i386
GVIZ=/usr/local/lib/graphviz
GVIZ_INC=$(GVIZ)/include
GVIZ_LIB=$(GVIZ)/build/$(GVIZ_ARCH)/lib
GVIZ_SRC=/usr/local/src/graphviz-1.8.5

GVIZ_EXTLIB_INC=-I/usr/include/freetype2
GVIZ_EXTLIB_LIB=-ljpeg -lpng -lfreetype -lz

You can see how those are used in the GNUmakefile.

Notice that I built the libraries to include jpeg, png, etc.  Here
are your two options with respect to those graphics libraries:

 1. If you'd like to use some of the command-line graph layout and
    drawing programs in the graphviz package (dot, neato, etc), then
    you need to include those libraries so that the programs can
    render layouts in jpeg, png, etc.
 2. If you don't expect to use those programs, then ggobi will be
    doing all the drawing, and you can edit gvconfig.h to exclude 
    the graphics libraries.
