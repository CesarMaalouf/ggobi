By default, this plugin knows about a single layout method, an
implementation of a radial layout, in which it lays out the nodes in
concentric circles, with the first node in the list appearing at the
center.

In order to use two more layout methods, pick up the graphviz package
from www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz.  I just (October 3, 2002) tested
the build process using graphviz-1.8.10.tar.gz, and it's working well.

When you build it, instead of using configure and gmake, follow the
instructions in graphviz/INSTALL.old, which does a better job of building
and installing the libraries and include files we need.

Here are the lines I use in my local.config file under linux:

GRAPHVIZ = 1
GVIZ_ARCH=linux.i386
GVIZ=/usr/local/lib/graphviz
GVINC=$(GVIZ)/include
GVLIB=$(GVIZ)/lib

GVIZ_EXTLIB_INC=-I/usr/include/freetype2
GVIZ_EXTLIB_LIB=-ljpeg -lpng -lfreetype -lz

You can see how those are used in the GNUmakefile.

Notice that I built the libraries to include jpeg, png, etc.  Here
are your two options with respect to those graphics libraries:

 1. If you'd like to use some of the command-line graph layout and
    drawing programs in the graphviz package (dot, neato, etc), then
    you need to include those libraries so that the programs can
    render layouts in jpeg, png, etc.
 2. If you don't expect to use those programs, then ggobi will be
    doing all the drawing, and you can edit gvconfig.h to exclude 
    the graphics libraries.
