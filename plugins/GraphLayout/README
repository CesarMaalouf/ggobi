By default, this plugin knows about a single layout method, an
implementation of a radial layout, in which it lays out the nodes in
concentric circles, with the first node in the list appearing at the
center.

In order to use two more layout methods, pick up the graphviz package
from graphviz.org.  Currently (May 11, 2004), you must use Version
1.12 which can be obtained here:
   http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html

Other instructions to build and use the graphviz methods in this
plugin:

GRAPHVIZ must be defined in your local.config file, ie
   GRAPHVIZ = 1
The build process depends on dotneato-config being in your PATH, and
the directory indicated by `dotneao-config --libs` must be in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order to use the layout methods.
