This is a small collection of examples illustrating how one can
use the java-gnome bindings for Java to Gtk within a GGobi plugin.

You will have to install that package and then set your classpath and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately to find the Java classes and JNI
libraries that implement that interface.

Assuming you specified the location of the java-gnome package when
configuring the JVM plugin, you can put the following contents of the
plugin.xml file in this directory into the <plugins> </plugins>
section of your GGobi intialization file.  (Otherwise, edit the file
and set the classpath correctly.)


Note that there is no need to call Gtk.main() in any of these classes
as the gtk event loop is already being run by GGobi.  If you do call
it, things will actually block!
