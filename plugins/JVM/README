This plugin provides support for the Java Virtual Machine within
GGobi. It is a meta-plugin in the sense that input and regular plugins
developed in Java can be run via this plugin.

Bindings for programming Gtk from within Java are available from
  http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/
There are some examples of using this in the Gtk/ directory and you
can enable these by specifying the location of the java-gnome
distribution when invoking configure, as in
 ./configure --with-java-gnome.

Hopefully this will serve as an example for embedding the Python and
Perl interpreters in GGobi in the same manner to allow plugins to be
developed using those languages.

To run this, you will need to do the following:

a)  copy the contents of the plugin.xml file into your 
    GGobi initialization file (~/.ggobirc by default)
    and place them within the <plugins> </plugins> section.

b) set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH  include the GGobi directory, this
   directory and the relevant JDK directories. You can use 
   the setLD.csh or setLD.bsh scripts to do this. The former
   is for those whose shell is csh or tcsh. The latter is for
   Bourne shell users. You need to source these into your existing
   shell, as in
    source setLD.csh
   or
    . setLD.bsh

Assuming you have compiled this plugin, you can go ahead and run
GGobi, e.g. 
      ../../ggobi ../../data/flea.xml 

If you have enabled support for java-gnome, the appropriate directory
will be added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting also.
