This plugin provides support for the Java Virtual Machine within
GGobi. It is a meta-plugin in the sense that input and regular plugins
developed in Java can be run via this plugin.

Bindings for programming Gtk from within Java
are available from
  http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/

Hopefully this will serve as an example for embedding the Python and
Perl interpreters in GGobi in the same manner to allow plugins to be
developed using those languages.
