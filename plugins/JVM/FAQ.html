      When I run the JVM plugin, I often get crashses, etc.
      In GDB, it runs for a couple of sessions and then
      I get an error like
<pre>
Program received signal SIG32, Real-time event 32.
0xf9600b8 in ?? ()
</pre>
      and I have to kill GDB. What's up?
  <dd>
    I think it is the fact that the JVM is threaded
      and ggobi is not (yet).
      As a result, the libraries they each depend on
      are different and subtle confusion can arise
      with resulting mayhem. In GDB, things are even
      more complicated.
