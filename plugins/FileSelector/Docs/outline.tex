The idea is that we will create an interactive input plugin that will
allow the user select files interactively using the gtk+-extra file
selector (or something similar).  This will guess the mode of the file
using the existing mechanism wheen it attempts to load the data.

We might also create a plugin that handles all input plugins.  The
idea is that we create a plugin that replaces or adds an alternative
Open menu item.  When invoked by the user, it would bring up a similar
GUI, but one that added a format control.  It would read these from
the input plugins available when the GUI was created.  The user would
select the file and the format and the associated plugin would be
used.
