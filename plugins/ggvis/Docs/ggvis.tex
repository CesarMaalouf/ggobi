\title{ggvis: graph layout as a plugin in {\tt ggobi}}
\author{Deborah F. Swayne}

\begin{abstract}
ggvis is a graph layout plugin for ggobi, and this manual
describes its use.  It can be expected to change and grow.
\end{abstract}

\section{The data}

First, you need some data.  The ascii format is not adequate
for the specification of edges, so you'll probably use an xml
file with at least two datasets:  a set of cases or nodes, and
a set of edges.  The records in the node data must have
\XMLAttribute{id}s:

\begin{verbatim}
<record id="0"> ... </record>
\end{verbatim}

The edge records use those \XMLAttribute{id}s to specify a
\XMLAttribute{source} and \XMLAttribute{destination}:

\begin{verbatim}
<record source="0" destination="2"> ... </record>
\end{verbatim}

The sample data that is discussed here is part of the ggobi distribution:
\file{snetwork.xml}, an artificial social network of 140 people who are
connected by 205 edges, representing some (unspecified) form of social
contact.  Notice that there are two variables recorded for each node,
and two variables for each edge.

In a ggobi scatterplot display, use the {\bf Edges} menu to
display the edges, and maybe the ``arrowheads'' which indicate
edge direction.  (Until the edges are displayed, neither layout
algorithm will work.)

\section{Layout}

There are two layout algorithms presently implemented in ggvis,
classical multidimensional scaling (with an optional force
adjustment algorithm), and a radial layout.

Find the ``Graph layout ...'' item on ggobi's Tools menu
to open the ggvis control panel.  It contains a ``notebook''
widget with one page for each layout method.

\subsection {Network layout}

This layout uses classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS).  CMDS yields a
layout in which the sum of squares of the physical distances between nodes
is as close as possible to the sum of squares of the ``link distances,''
that is, the number of edges in the shortest path between $node_i$
to $node_j$.

Click on ``cmds.''

Layouts produced by MDS are dominated by large distances, so it
is sometimes useful to apply a few iterations of a force adjustment
algorithm to spread out the leaf nodes.  Force adjustment algorithms
are sometime called spring algorithms because they model a graph as
a physical system, a collection of weights and springs.

\subsection {Radial layout}

\section{Interactions}

% One specifies a plugin using the usual XML \XMLTag{plugin} syntax in
% an initialization file for GGobi.  For an R plugin, one specifies a
% \XMLAttr{language} attribute with a value \verb+"R"+.  (One should
% declare the R (meta-) plugin itself before this.)  In addition to the
% usual \XMLTag{description} and \XMLTag{author} information, one
% provides values for the \XMLAttr{init} and \XMLAttr{create} attributes
% of the \XMLTag{plugin} tag.
