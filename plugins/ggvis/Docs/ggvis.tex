\title{ggvis: multidimensional scaling as a plugin in {\tt ggobi}}
\author{Deborah F. Swayne and Andreas Buja}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
ggvis is a plugin for ggobi, and this short manual begins
to describe its use.  It is a port of xgvis,  previously
available as part of the xgobi software.
\end{abstract}

\section{The data}

First, you need some data.  The ascii format supported by ggobi is not
adequate for the specification of edges, so you'll probably use an xml
file with a minimum of two datasets:  a set of cases or nodes, and a set
of edges.  The records in the node data must have
\XMLAttribute{id}s:

\begin{verbatim}
<record id="0"> ... </record>
<record id="1"> ... </record>
\end{verbatim}

The edge records use those \XMLAttribute{id}s to specify a
\XMLAttribute{source} and \XMLAttribute{destination}:

\begin{verbatim}
<record source="0" destination="1"> ... </record>
\end{verbatim}

No two records in the same xml file may have the same record id.

The sample data that is discussed here is part of the ggobi distribution:
\file{snetwork.xml}, an artificial social network of 140 people who are
connected by 205 edges, representing some (unspecified) form of social
contact.  Notice that there are two variables recorded for each node,
and two variables for each edge.

In a ggobi scatterplot display, use the {\bf Edges} menu to
display the edges, and maybe the ``arrowheads'' which indicate
edge direction.

\section{Specifying the datasets}

Initiate the plugin by selecting the ``ggvis (MDS) ...'' item on ggobi's
Tools menu.  The ggvis control panel starts with a ``notebook''
widget with three tabs.  The first tab, ``Specify datasets,'' contains
two lists, one for datasets which can supply nodes and one for datasets
which can supply edges.  In most cases, only one choice is possible,
but more complex arrangements can occur.

The {\em snetwork.xml} data supplied with ggobi has exactly one set of
nodes and one set of edges.  For this data, there are no choices to be
made, and you can simply move on to run multidimensional scaling.

With the {\em morsecodes.xml} data, there are in fact two sets of edges.
The first one, ``distance,'' supplies the distances to be used in
determining the point positions.  The second set, ``edges,'' is a set of edges
that can be used for display, because it emphasizes the structure of
of the data.

\section{Running MDS}

This section documentation has not yet been written, but we can
refer you to documentation for the older {\em xgvis}
(\cite{xgvis_jcgs2002}, http://www.research.att.com/areas/stat/xgobi/), which
was used with xgobi, ggobi's predecessor.

\section{Manipulations}

All the standard ggobi direct manipulations are available.  Plots of
the graph can obviously be linked node-wise to plots of node covariates.
What might be less obvious is that they can also be linked to plots of
edge covariates, so that an edge in the graph corresponds to a node in the
plot of edge data.  Nodes can be interactively brushed and ``identified;''
edges can be brushed -- to set the color of the line type and width.
The ``color schemes'' tool can be used to automatically color the nodes
or the edges.

Nodes can also be moved, which can help untangle the layout a bit.
Groups of nodes can be moved together: first brush them with
the same symbol and color, and then select {\tt Move brush group}
in the {\tt Move points} ViewMode.

% This functionality is to be implemented in a new plugin.
% There is only one added manipulation, and that puts it an appearance
% during the use of identification in a radial layout.  When a node is
% made ``sticky,'' a set of nodes and edges are are highlighted using
% the current brushing color:  the sticky node, its edges, and all
% nodes to which those edges are connected.  To remove the
% highlighting, click again on the node to make it unsticky.

\subsection{Thinning the graph}

Brushing can be used to thin the plot, by hiding nodes with especially
high in or out degree, for example, or nodes with large values of depth.
Once those nodes are hidden, a new layout can be produced.

\section{Plot control from R}

If you have launched ggobi from within R, you can use the API to
drive the plot.  Here are some fragments of code in the S language
that I have used.

In the first example, I have two xml files representing two
related graphs, and I'm interested in comparing them.  This is
part of the code used to highlight the edges the two graphs
have in common.

\begin{verbatim}
g1 <- ggobi("f1.xml")
setDisplayEdges.ggobi(.gobi=g1)
e1 <- getEdges.ggobi(.data=2, .gobi=g1)
g2 <- ggobi("f2.xml")
setDisplayEdges.ggobi(.gobi=g2)
e2 <- getEdges.ggobi(.data=2, .gobi=g2)
...
esame1 <- enames1 %in% enames2
edgecolors1 <- rep(1, nedges1)
edgecolors1[esame1==T] <- 6
setColors.ggobi (edgecolors1, .data=2, .gobi=g1)
...
\end{verbatim}


In the second example, there is one graph, and its edge covariates are
the values of a variable recorded for each edge at $t_i$.  I use R to
animate the graph, using color to encode the edge weight; I first chose
a sequential colorscheme.  Similarly, one could use setGlyphs.ggobi() to
set node type or size.  The same command sets edge type or thickness
when applied to the edge data.  To hide some of the edges, use
setHiddenCases.ggobi().

\begin{verbatim}
edges <- getData.ggobi(2)
ntimesteps <- dim(edges)[2]

for (i in 1:ntimesteps) {
  tgraph (i, edges)
  ...
  colors <- integer(dim(edges)[1])
  colors[lnw>(3*mx/4)] <- 5
  colors[lnw>(mx/2) & lnw<=(3*mx/4)] <- 4
  colors[lnw>(mx/4) & lnw<=(mx/2)] <- 3
  colors[lnw>0 & lnw<=(mx/4)] <- 2
  setColors.ggobi (colors, 1:length(colors), 2)
}
\end{verbatim}

In an extension of the second example, the xml file includes three
datasets.  The third is of dimension $ntimesteps$ by $2$, and its
single time series plot represents the sum of all measurements
for all edges at each time step.  As the animation runs,
we highlight the corresponding point in a scatterplot of this time series.

\begin{verbatim}
tcolors <- integer(ntimesteps)
tcolors[1:length(tcolors)] <- 3
tcolors[i] <- 7
setColors.ggobi (tcolors, 1:length(tcolors), 3)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Related work}

Another plugin, GraphLayout, offers several methods for laying
out graphs.  One of its methods, called neato, produces layouts
that are similar to those of ggvis.

\section{Future work}

A third plugin, not yet named, will allow manipulations of
graphs, independent of the layout method used.
