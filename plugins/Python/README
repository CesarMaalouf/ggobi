To test this plugin, you can use the following command

   ../../ggobi --plugin=tests/plugin.xml-test ../../data/flea.xml

from within this directory.

To implement a plugin (not an input plugin yet), one can either extend
the GGobiPythonPlugin class in the python/GGobiPlugin.py file or
simply implement a new class with methods identical in signature to
those in that class.
