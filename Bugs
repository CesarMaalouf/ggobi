Open a ggobi and an XY scatterplot. Go to 2d touring and then pause
it.  Open a second XY plot window and do a 1 d plot and then
change to texturing rather than ASH.  The tour is running.

  Firstly, the tour should be off. 

  Secondly, the plot is the wrong one (or is it supposed to do this anyway).
  Looks like we are setting it in gg as well as the displayd.




When changing modes, etc. in a different window,
the points under the brush in a different window are
not reflected in this new window.
  Need to honor the currently selected points.




Insert mode for a scatterplot matrix not inserting
  At least in Rggobi.
    rtraffic data from John Rice's lab.

  Have to select diagonal entry. But the message should come up on
the main window, not the console.
 
  See scatmat.c:596.
   Need to make the message go away again.
       Use a stack of messages.

   Or alternatively entirely, perhaps an error dialog is the appropriate thing.
