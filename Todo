If read xml file from a URL, then want to compute the relative files
by filling out the InputDescription. See fileset_generate....


Fix the names and ids in the color map specification. Need to
determine what is the relationship between these.

Check the fileselection dialog for read (filesel_ok) to ensure that
the correct data mode is passed.  Take it out of ggobi.

From John Plummer: 
  It would be nice if the file finder remembered the
    directory where the last file retrieved was stored.
  Let any variable be the label used in identification

Bugs: 

  Set the brush to any region  (manually) and then reduce the
   size of the window.  Note that the brush size stays
   fixed and is not scaled and points enter the region but are
   not "brushed."

  It's no longer possible to read an ascii file that doesn't
    have the .dat suffix -- I regard this as a bug.

  If a new datad is added, the transformation, jittering, and 
    brush_by_variable tools are not going to show it in their
    notebooks.

Reading in new data
  add an option:  add a new datad or replace an existing one

In progress, needing design discussions:
  Deleting variables: how should plots behave? (disabled for now)
    [If plotted, give a warning; otherwise, proceed]
  Should the variable stats table open by default when other tools open?

various stuff not yet implemented:
  Options on options menu
  show/hide missings button
  1d cycling 

Graphs
  line type brushing
  line editing  <- depends on the ability to add a record

API code needed:
  sticky labels
  imputation of missing values
  setting variable ranges
  adding, deleting variables
  sphering

I/O -- the biggest part is now in place.  extend
  user options to write_xml.  Add the ability to extend the
  current file set by one or more files.  (wait until the
  dtd has been redesigned to handle multiple datad objects)

  How do we write out missings in xml?
  If all glyphs are the same, there's no need to write 
    a glyph description in each record

saving plots as .svg files
  work out how to do nested transformations for printing parcoords
    and scatmat plots

Tour:
  dumps core in cloning (and therefore in sphering)
  rulers
  axes
  put arrays and vectors into the standard routines that debby has developed.
  tour data structure
  why is there whip-spin?
  tour API
  PP
  manual controls
  1d tour
  correlation tour
  history controls


keep working on array and vector management

when brushing or identifying in parcoords, use leave/enter events to
  change the current_splot?
  
Scaling:
  take advantage of the cleverness of the axes:  l to shift, m/r to scale
  couple that with a thumbnail view that sits just below the scaling controls

Smoothing -- as a demo, at least, of the use of R

Food for thought:
  * maps; data as polygons -- for summer 2001?
  * Do we need rotation at all?
  * If we bin the screen hierarchically, the bins could be used
    for edges as well as for points.

! it now works to start ggobi without an argument; a necessary step
! in the API preparation.

! add "size only" to the list of color and glyph, color only, etc.

! Rename gtour_ui.c to tour2d_ui.c

! Use a notebook for the advanced tour panel

! Rename display_reproject to display_tailpipe

! The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
! receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
! that's why the lines aren't appearing
  
! Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
! the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
! factor.
  
! I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
! yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.
  
! Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.
  
! The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
! file unless the file has an na in it.
  
! Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
! transformation

! sphering labels aren't being reset

! selected_variables_get isn't always right -- maybe it gets messed
!   up after the clear?  (so maybe it's fixed)

! still having problems with variable selection in scatterplot matrices
!   put a check in splot_redraw

! Brushing:  add brush-jumps-to-cursor

! parcoords: when switching between row and col layout, plot orientation
!   and whiskers aren't being reset correctly
!      added the needed lines to sp_rewhisker; added display_tailpipe
!      to the rearrangement callback.

! when reading from the file menu, the variable labels aren't read
!    I was using filename (with suffix) instead of fname (without)
!    Do I need to keep filename for anything?

! Line brushing

! Erase/hiding/exclusion  (done; could use a redo button)
!   fix up for api

! closing the 'choose symbol' window dumps core
! the brush isn't redrawing when a new color is selected
! the axes aren't being initialized properly for cloned variables.

! reset zoom doesn't work  ; added

! I haven't seen this -- dfs
! there seems to be rounding error in the pipeline. 
! Create a scatterplot, and then resize to something very small.
! Then open it up again to the original size approximately
! and all the points will have gravitated towards the 0,0 
! (upper left) corner.

! sticky labels -- just draw them without the underline and the diamond

! brush_pos should be per-display.  -- in fact made it per-splot

! exclusion:  rebuilding the table on the fly -- just destroy and
!   rebuild, as we did in xgobi

! Window menu:  build it more permanently, and then rebuild it
!   whenever the number (or contents) of the d's has changed.

! moving points -- works in 2d plots

! sphering needs to check whether the d it's working with has
!    changed; done
! sphering: redesigned the tool window

! check for note in transform.c : static variables eliminated

! add notebook controls to the exclusion window

! Variable panel:
!  add a divider between the sections; using etched frames 
!  it doesn't refresh correctly.
!  the menus pop up in the wrong place

! Brushing: 
!  when moving between datad's, the colors shown in the exclude window
!   get confused

! figure out context-sensitive tooltips for the variable
!   selection panel

! user limits need to be checked before transforming

! sphere data into new variables instead of overwriting
!   the existing values -- that will test cloning!

! When we add a dataset after loading the first one (i.e. in a separate
! action) the first tab of the notebook does not have the correct labe
! (it appears as Page 1).

! Moving points
!   add point labels as in xgobi

! Add a close button or menu item to each tool.

!For subsetting et al
!  add an option menu allowing the selection of a datad

! Reset->'show all points' doesn't override the clusters tool.  
!   What to do?
