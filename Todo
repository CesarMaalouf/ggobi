Bugs: 

  the axes aren't being initialized properly for cloned variables.
  reading from stdin in stopped working
  scatterplot matrix:  ASH is vertical instead of horizontal
                       replacement mode isn't working
                       maybe its cpanel isn't initialized correctly?
  the brush isn't redrawing when a new color is selected
  reset zoom doesn't work; reset pan is fine
  closing the 'choose symbol' window dumps core

Scaling:
  take advantage of the cleverness of the axes:  l to shift, m/r to scale
  couple that with a thumbnail view that sits just below the scaling controls

Imputation of missing values

Erase/hiding/exclusion  (done; could use a redo button)
  fix up for api

Use a set of decoration arrays (points and lines) instead of nlinkable

Smoothing

API code

Line brushing: code is in but not debugged

Line editing
Move points

I/O


! it now works to start ggobi without an argument; a necessary step
! in the API preparation.

! add "size only" to the list of color and glyph, color only, etc.

! Rename gtour_ui.c to tour2d_ui.c

! Use a notebook for the advanced tour panel

! Rename display_reproject to display_tailpipe

! The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
! receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
! that's why the lines aren't appearing
  
! Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
! the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
! factor.
  
! I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
! yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.
  
! Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.
  
! The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
! file unless the file has an na in it.
  
! Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
! transformation

! sphering labels aren't being reset

! selected_variables_get isn't always right -- maybe it gets messed
!   up after the clear?  (so maybe it's fixed)

! still having problems with variable selection in scatterplot matrices
!   put a check in splot_redraw

! Brushing:  add brush-jumps-to-cursor

! parcoords: when switching between row and col layout, plot orientation
!   and whiskers aren't being reset correctly
!      added the needed lines to sp_rewhisker; added display_tailpipe
!      to the rearrangement callback.

! when reading from the file menu, the variable labels aren't read
!    I was using filename (with suffix) instead of fname (without)
!    Do I need to keep filename for anything?
