Bugs: 
  none I need to deal with at the moment

various stuff not yet implemented: 
  1d, xy cycling
  window closings
  sticky labels

  brush_pos should be per-display.  when brushing or identifying in
  parcoords, use leave/enter events to change the current_splot.

array and vector management

color:  allow additional colormaps -- .cmap file
  
Scaling:
  take advantage of the cleverness of the axes:  l to shift, m/r to scale
  couple that with a thumbnail view that sits just below the scaling controls

Imputation of missing values -- only the simple-minded stuff, and leave
  the rest to R

allow initializing parcoords and scatmat plots from selected vars

Use a set of decoration arrays (points and lines) instead of nlinkable

Smoothing -- to take advantage of the R loess code
  wait until we think about decoration?

API code

line type brushing

Move points
Line editing

old-style I/O

Rotation -- maybe never

Graphs
  Edges with data: a separate region of the variable selection panel
  Linking points to edges

Maps
  polygonal data


! it now works to start ggobi without an argument; a necessary step
! in the API preparation.

! add "size only" to the list of color and glyph, color only, etc.

! Rename gtour_ui.c to tour2d_ui.c

! Use a notebook for the advanced tour panel

! Rename display_reproject to display_tailpipe

! The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
! receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
! that's why the lines aren't appearing
  
! Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
! the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
! factor.
  
! I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
! yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.
  
! Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.
  
! The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
! file unless the file has an na in it.
  
! Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
! transformation

! sphering labels aren't being reset

! selected_variables_get isn't always right -- maybe it gets messed
!   up after the clear?  (so maybe it's fixed)

! still having problems with variable selection in scatterplot matrices
!   put a check in splot_redraw

! Brushing:  add brush-jumps-to-cursor

! parcoords: when switching between row and col layout, plot orientation
!   and whiskers aren't being reset correctly
!      added the needed lines to sp_rewhisker; added display_tailpipe
!      to the rearrangement callback.

! when reading from the file menu, the variable labels aren't read
!    I was using filename (with suffix) instead of fname (without)
!    Do I need to keep filename for anything?

! Line brushing

! Erase/hiding/exclusion  (done; could use a redo button)
!   fix up for api
<<<<<<< Todo

! closing the 'choose symbol' window dumps core
! the brush isn't redrawing when a new color is selected
! the axes aren't being initialized properly for cloned variables.
