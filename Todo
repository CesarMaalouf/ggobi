Bugs: 

  the axes aren't being initialized properly for cloned variables.
  still having problems with variable selection in scatterplot matrices

Find out how to handle threads
Find out how to use signals

Scaling:
  take advantage of the cleverness of the axes:  l to shift, m/r to scale
  couple that with a thumbnail that sits just below the scaling controls



! add "size only" to the list of color and glyph, color only, etc.

! Rename gtour_ui.c to tour2d_ui.c

! Use a notebook for the advanced tour panel

! Rename display_reproject to display_tailpipe

! The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
! receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
! that's why the lines aren't appearing
  
! Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
! the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
! factor.
  
! I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
! yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.
  
! Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.
  
! The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
! file unless the file has an na in it.
  
! Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
! transformation

! sphering labels aren't being reset

! selected_variables_get isn't always right -- maybe it gets messed
!   up after the clear?  (so maybe it's fixed)
