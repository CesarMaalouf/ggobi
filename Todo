Bugs: 

  Set the brush to any region  (manually) and then reduce the
   size of the window.  Note that the brush size stays
   fixed and is not scaled and points enter the region but are
   not "brushed"

  adding and removing plots in scatmat continues to be problematic

Think about variable selection for
    initiating (or updating) parcoords and scatmat plots
    transformation, imputation, jittering, saving
  Shall we use the variable statistics panel, or a separate
  variable selection dialog?  (in vardialog_ui.c)

various stuff not yet implemented: 
  1d, xy cycling
  window closings

  line type brushing
  line editing

  row groups
  line groups

  moving points

brush_pos should be per-display.  when brushing or identifying in
  parcoords, use leave/enter events to change the current_splot.

  exclusion:  rebuilding the table on the fly

keep working on array and vector management

color:  allow additional colormaps -- .cmap file
  (DTL: This is supported in the XML.)
  
Scaling:
  take advantage of the cleverness of the axes:  l to shift, m/r to scale
  couple that with a thumbnail view that sits just below the scaling controls

Imputation of missing values -- simple imputation is done; extend
  the API for the rest.

Use a set of decoration arrays (points and lines) instead of nlinkable

Smoothing -- to take advantage of the R loess code
  wait until we think about decoration?

API code -- sticky labels

old-style I/O -- the biggest part is now in place.  extend
  user options to write_xml.  Add the ability to extend the
  current file set by one or more files.

Rotation -- maybe never

Categorical data?

Graphs
  Edges with data: a separate region of the variable selection panel

Maps
  polygonal data


! it now works to start ggobi without an argument; a necessary step
! in the API preparation.

! add "size only" to the list of color and glyph, color only, etc.

! Rename gtour_ui.c to tour2d_ui.c

! Use a notebook for the advanced tour panel

! Rename display_reproject to display_tailpipe

! The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
! receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
! that's why the lines aren't appearing
  
! Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
! the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
! factor.
  
! I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
! yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.
  
! Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.
  
! The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
! file unless the file has an na in it.
  
! Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
! transformation

! sphering labels aren't being reset

! selected_variables_get isn't always right -- maybe it gets messed
!   up after the clear?  (so maybe it's fixed)

! still having problems with variable selection in scatterplot matrices
!   put a check in splot_redraw

! Brushing:  add brush-jumps-to-cursor

! parcoords: when switching between row and col layout, plot orientation
!   and whiskers aren't being reset correctly
!      added the needed lines to sp_rewhisker; added display_tailpipe
!      to the rearrangement callback.

! when reading from the file menu, the variable labels aren't read
!    I was using filename (with suffix) instead of fname (without)
!    Do I need to keep filename for anything?

! Line brushing

! Erase/hiding/exclusion  (done; could use a redo button)
!   fix up for api

! closing the 'choose symbol' window dumps core
! the brush isn't redrawing when a new color is selected
! the axes aren't being initialized properly for cloned variables.

! reset zoom doesn't work  ; added

! I haven't seen this -- dfs
! there seems to be rounding error in the pipeline. 
! Create a scatterplot, and then resize to something very small.
! Then open it up again to the original size approximately
! and all the points will have gravitated towards the 0,0 
! (upper left) corner.

! sticky labels -- just draw them without the underline and the diamond
