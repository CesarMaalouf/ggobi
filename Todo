Bug: 

the axes aren't being initialized properly for cloned variables.

still having problems with variable selection in scatterplot matrices

! sphering labels aren't being reset

! selected_variables_get isn't always right -- maybe it gets messed
!   up after the clear?  (so maybe it's fixed)

Find out how to handle threads!  and to generate signals, too.

Scaling:
  take advantage of the cleverness of the axes:  l to shift, m/r to scale
  couple that with a thumbnail that sits just below the scaling controls

Brushing:
  for dealing with weighted data, handle the case where the users
  either 
    (1) supply input data with a wider range of sizes, or
    (2) set the glyph sizes from outside (eg, R) to a wider
        range of sizes

  further, add to the list of
    color and glyph
    color only
    glyph only
    glyph size only
