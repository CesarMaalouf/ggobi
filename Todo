The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
that's why the lines aren't appearing

Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
factor.

I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.

Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.

The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
file unless the file has an na in it.

Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
transformation
