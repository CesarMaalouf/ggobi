test variable selection in the scatterplot matrix

Tooltips offer no help with missings, or how to do variable
selection for jittering or transformation

Transformation: add sphering

Brushing: erase/hide/exclude

Axes for scatterplot matrix, parallel coordinates

Implement various display options:
  plot cycling
  Main:
    Brush jumps to cursor
    Update linked brushing continuously ?
  Scatterplot et al:
    Directed lines?
  Parcoords: double buffer
    

Resetting vgroups

!Try to add the missings work without being too kludgey.
!The 1d plotting section is still unsatisfactory.

!The missing program doesn't pay attention to the .missing
!file unless the file has an na in it.

!rulers are not properly adjusting in missing scatterplots
!  embedded a check for missing_p in splot_screen_to_tform

!The parallel coordinates plot is drawing (not because it
!receives an expose event, either) before it is configured --
!that's why the lines aren't appearing

!Jittering doesn't know whether it's supposed to adjust
!the column jitter value or the missing values jittering
!factor.

!I've added an array to the missing values pipeline, but not
!yet changed how missing_world_data is computed.

!the constant resizing of the main window is still irritating:
!I need to figure out the maximum size and never shrink it
!automatically.  For that matter, the plot windows shrink, too.
!  turned off auto_shrink everywhere

!Noted in xgobi:  ashes are not being recomputed after a
!transformation
!  no problem in ggobi, because p1d_reproject calls ..spread_var

! Default:  if no variables selected, jitter/transform the
! currently plotted variables.  Implemented for jittering, tform;
! needs to be in a function.
! Todo: when vartable implemented, it should use the 
! 'selected' information.

! ASH smoothness

! Show missings: implemented for parcoords and scatmat; too hard for
! scatterplot matrix

! Using queue_redraw upon startup, but handling the drawing myself for
! all the interactions.

! Variable menus for scatterplot matrix, parallel coordinates

! Subsetting: the basics are in place
