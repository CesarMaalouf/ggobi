/* global header file for GGobi */

// FIXME: These need to become <ggobi/foo.h>, meaning that we have to rename
// 'src' to 'ggobi' and put -I.. on the compiler line. The header files should
// be installed to /usr/include/ggobi-3.0/ggobi with -I/usr/include/ggobi-3.0
// provided by pkg-config.
#include "bitset.h"
#include "vars.h"
#include "externs.h"
