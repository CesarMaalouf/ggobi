To build with purify, here's what I had to do on the SGI:

It turns out that everything has to have been compiled with the same
compiler -- glib, gtk, and ggobi.  That means that it's necessary to
construct a separate tree for glib and gtk that have been compiled
with cc, and build ggobi against those.

Sources are in /usr/dfs/src.

Step 1: glib

CC=/usr/bin/cc ./configure --prefix=/usr/dfs/cc 
make install

Step 2: gtk

export GLIB_CONFIG=/usr/dfs/cc/bin/glib-config
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/dfs/cc/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH=/usr/dfs/cc/lib:$LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH
PATH=/usr/dfs/cc/bin:$PATH
export CC=/usr/bin/cc
./configure --prefix=/usr/dfs/cc
make install

Step 3: ggobi

export CC=/usr/bin/cc
export GLIB_CONFIG=/usr/dfs/cc/bin/glib-config
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/dfs/cc/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH=/usr/dfs/cc/lib:$LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH
PATH=/usr/dfs/cc/bin:$PATH
export GTK_CONFIG=/usr/dfs/cc/bin/gtk-config

Makefile:
  CC=cc
  CFLAGS
local.config
  use XML libraries compiled with cc
