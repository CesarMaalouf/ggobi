We have several places where we use 
#ifndef Darwin
in the code to control the inclusion of 
header files.
This seems to be a throwback to an early version of
Mac OS X's pre-processr (cpp).
In version 3.3, Darwin is not defined.
So we need to change this. 
Testing for 

  #if !defined __APPLE__ && !defined __GNUC__

is more appropriate but still not necessarily correct.
The test for Darwin was too simple as it didn't
admit the possibility of another compiler.

To find the set of prefined processor symbols, use
  touch /tmp/foo.h
  cpp -dM /tmp/foo.h



I have not abstracted this into a single definition
as I would like.  This is because I don't want to modify
the code at the moment to rearrange the header files.
