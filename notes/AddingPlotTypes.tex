This document describes some of the issues related to introducing a
new plot type for ggobi.  Since we have designed ggobi to be
extensible in some sense (not in an object-oriented manner) and to be
embedded in to other systems such as S, Python, Perl, etc.  it is
important that the plots provide an easy and consistent API so that
they can share common facilities and simplify the task of developers
integrating into these other languages.

\item[name] 
\item[description]
\item[setVariable]
\item[multiple variables]
\end{description}


Please keep the user interface material in a separate file from the
internal operations of the plot.  The GUI aspects are essentially the
view and the control elements of the Model-View-Control
pattern\cite{DesignPatterns}.

It is important that the internals be exposed via additions to the
ggobi API. This allows the developers of interfaces to other languages
easily provide connections for this plot type.

Use enumerations for a list of possible types,
e.g. the \Cvariable{tsplot_arrangement}.
