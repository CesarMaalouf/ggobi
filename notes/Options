The different boolean variables that were used in displayd to control
the appearance of the plot (e.g. presence or absence of a grid, axes,
whether to show line segments, etc.) have been moved into their own
structure, DisplayOptions. This is defined in types.h.
Each displayd has a field of this type.

There is a global instance of this which is copied to a newly created
displayd object. Thus, one can change the values of the template and
have them propogated to all plots generated subsequently.

Each displayd has its own copy of these rather than linking them all
together. Hopefully this is simpler. However, different semantics
which has the changes propogate to all plots are also feasible.

Perhaps we might use the hierarchical display tree to allow applying
changes to these defaults to all selected plots. (Low priority, if at
all.)


R/S

 In R and S, we can query and set the values of the options
fields. This can apply to any displayd object or the default options
template (DefaultDisplayOptions).
