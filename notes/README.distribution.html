<h1>Creating the ggobi Distribution</h1>


There are two ways that others (non-developers) can get the ggobi
source. One is via CVS and the other is by downloading the
ggobi.tar.gz source distribution. The next paragraphs describe how
to create the <i>ggobi.tar.gz</i> file.

<p>
<font color="red">When we refer to the command <b>make</b>,
this means the GNU version of make and may be installed on your
computer as <b>gmake</b>.</font>
<p>

There are just a few simple steps in creating ggobi.tar.gz.
<ol>
<li> Change directory to the top-level ggobi/ directory as checked out
from CVS.  This directory contains the .c and .h files such as
ggobi.c, p1d.c, etc. and also the Install/ and notes/ directory.

<li> Make certain to do a cvs update and also a cvs commit so that the
CVS repository is totally synchronized with the files in the release
that you are creating.  One should also use 'cvs tag some-id' to give
this an identifier. This synchronization makes it much easier to
re-create the exact state of affairs for that release when we get a
bug report about a particular distribution.

<li> To create the <i>ggobi.tar.gz</i>, type
<pre>
       gmake ADMIN=1 tar
</pre>
What this does is to create an entirely new directory structure in
<i>/tmp/Install/ggobi</i>. This new directory containins the source and
documentation files for building ggobi and puts them in the
appropriate directory layout so that configure (the autoconf script)
and GNUmakefiles work correctly.

<p/>
To test that this distribution does in fact work, one should
start with
<pre>
 gmake ADMIN=1
</pre>
and then change directory to <i>/tmp/Install/ggobi</i>
and perform the installation as a regular user would.
<pre>
  cd /tmp/Install/ggobi
  ./configure
  make
</pre>
Then, run the compile ggobi
<pre>
  ./bin/ggobi data/flea    
</pre>    
</ol>

<h2>Removing or Adding a File</h2>

If you add or remove a <i>.c</i> or <i>.h</i> file from the ggobi
codebase, then your will have edited the <b>Makefile</b> in the
<i>ggobi/</i> directory of your working copy of the code checked out
from CVS.  You will also need to tell the installation scripts about
the change.  When one calls <code>make ADMIN=1</code> this uses the
rules in the <i>GNUmakefile.admin</i> in the <i>Install/</i>
directory.  This file is responsible for copying all of the relevant
files from your ggobi working directory to <i>/tmp/Install/ggobi</i>.
It copies all of the C files listed in the regular, top-level
<b>Makefile</b> in the <b>SRC</b> variable.
Therefore, any new files that are needed for the build
or files that are removed should be handled automatically.
<p/>

Now, when one goes to build the distribution in
<i>/tmp/Install/ggobi</i> the <i>src/GNUmakefile</i> needs to know
which files to compile.  So you must edit the file
<b>Install/GNUmakefile_src.in</b> in your working directory (i.e. not
the directory <i>/tmp/Install/ggobi/</i>) and edit the list of files
specified there in the <b>SRC</b> variable.
    


<h3>Committing Removed files</h3>

Also, if you remove a file, please use the commands
<pre>
    cvs remove whatever-file
    cvs commit -m "Removing the file whatever-file because ..."  whatever-file
</pre>
This means that when others update, their working copies will have
this file removed.  It is a way of notifying others about the change.


<h2>PDF and the Distribution</h2>

The plan is that the distribution contains the PDF versions of some of
the files in the <i>notes/</i> directory.  To create this, you will
need pdflatex which is not necessarily installed on all machines.
Either we can change this and distribute Postscript versions
created using regular <b>latex</b> and <b>dvips</b> or one person can
be responsible for creating the actual public distribution.

<p>
To create the Postscript versions instead of the PDF ones,
create the working distribution as
<pre>
 make ADMIN=1 DOC_EXTENSION=ps
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, to avoid including any of these documents,
invoke make as
<pre>
 make ADMIN=1 DOC_TEX_FILES=
</pre>
which just sets DOC_TEX_FILES to an empty list.
