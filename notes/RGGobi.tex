\begin{abstract}
  In this document, we describe some of the features of the R-GGobi
  link. We illustrate some of the common uses and the different
  functions to both query and modify the state of the GGobi.  This
  serves as a form of a tutorial.

\section{Getting Started}
The first thing to do is create a ggobi instance.
Each instance is associated with a particular dataset.
There are two ways to create this.
One specifies the name of the file to read
and the other takes a data frame or matrix in R.
The first takes a string, such as
\begin{verbatim}
 > ggobi("../data/flea")
\end{verbatim}
The second form passes the data frame as the first argument.
\begin{verbatim}
 > data(mtcars)
 > ggobi(mtcars)
\end{verbatim}
Both of these create ggobi in the same manner as the stand-alone
application via the command line.  One can pass a vector of strings as
arguments which are processed as command line arguments.  When
specifying the name of a file, one can specify whether this is XML,
ASCII or binary.

We can create a ggobi instance with no data and set the data in a
later command.
\begin{verbatim}
 > ggobi()
\end{verbatim}


At any point, the dataset can be augmented or reduced by
adding or removing variables.
\begin{verbatim}
 ggobi.addVariable()
 ggobi.removeVariable()
\end{verbatim}

\section{System Values}
The representation of points or observations within a plot is
controlled by its glyph.  Each observation has its own glyph
setting. This controls the type  and size of glyph.
(In the near future, these may be indepdently settable across
sub-plots.)
The possible values for the glyph type and size
are fixed for a ggobi session.
They can be queried via the functions
\SFunction{ggobi.getGlyphTypes}
and 
\SFunction{ggobi.getGlyphSizes}

\begin{verbatim}
> ggobi.getGlyphTypes()
 +  x or fr oc fc  . 
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7 
> ggobi.getGlyphSizes()
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
\end{verbatim}

Each ggobi instance has its own color map.  The color of each
observation is specified as a row index into this colormap.  Each row
of this map or table is an RGB color value.

\begin{verbatim}
> ggobi.getColorMap()
         Red        Green      Blue
1  1.0000000 0.0008697642 0.0000000
2  1.0000000 0.2699931334 0.0000000
3  1.0000000 0.5499961852 0.0000000
4  1.0000000 0.8399938964 0.0000000
5  1.0000000 1.0000000000 0.0000000
6  0.0000000 0.7499961852 1.0000000
7  0.5099870 0.4399938964 1.0000000
8  0.6000000 0.8000000000 0.2000000
9  0.0000000 0.9799954223 0.6000000
10 0.7299916 0.3299916075 0.8299992
\end{verbatim}

One can set the color map with the function
\SFunction{ggobi.setColorMap}.
To change, for example, the second row
to the values $.8, .2. 3$,
we can use the following steps
\begin{verbatim}
 mp <- ggobi.getColorMap()
 mp[2,] <- c(.8,.2,.3)
 ggobi.setColorMap(mp)
\end{verbatim}




\section{Callbacks}
Associating R function calls with events in GGobi is a valuable way to
allow customization of the existing interactivity provided by GGobi.
Consider an example where we have a scatterplot of two variables X and
Y.  As we identify individual points in the scatterplot, we might want
to perform examine the result of fitting the regression of Y on X with
that point omitted.  GGobi does not currently provide such a facility.
However, it is trivial in R.  By allowing one to register an R
function to be called when a particular event (the identification)
occurs. Allows us to easily do this.




\section{API Routines}
In this section we describe the different R/S functions that one can
invoke to query and modify the state of the GGobi session.  There are
some common concepts shared between most of these functions.

Firstly, there are some global variables that are properties of the
entire ggobi system.  These are things such as the color table, the
glyph types and sizes.  These can be considered fixed, but queryable.

Within a ggobi session, one can view different datasets
simultaneously. Each dataset corresponds to its own ggobi data
instance within the single session.  (Note that this is different from
xgobi in which only one dataset could be introduced into the a
process.)

Within each ggobi instance, one can have multiple windows, also known
as displays.  Each display has one or more plots within it.  The plots
can be a
\begin{itemize}
\item $1$ variable plot
such as ASH plots,
\item  scatterplot of two variables
\item scatter matrix of 2 or more variables
\item parallel coordinates plot of $k$ variables.
\end{itemize}

This hierarchical setup is displayed in the following
figure.
\begin{center}
\pstree{\Tr{Session}}{%
 \pstree{\Tr{dataset}}{%
    \pstree{\Tr{display}}{
      \Tr{plot}
      \Tr{$\vdots$}
      \Tr{plot}
    }
 }
 \Tr{$\ldots$}
 \pstree{\Tr{dataset}}{%
    \pstree{\Tr{display}}{
      \Tr{plot}
      \Tr{$\vdots$}
      \Tr{plot}
    }
 }
}  
\end{center}

When operating with multiple datasets in the ggobi session at any one
time, it is important to identify to which instance a command should
be directed.  For example, if we wish to get information on the
variables within a particular instance of a ggobi instance, we can
call \SFunction{ggobi.getVariableNames}. However, we must
specify the ggobi instance in question. All the functions
that operate on a ggobi instance have an optional argument,
\SArg{.ggobi}, which is an integer.
If omitted, this defaults to the currently active
ggobi instance.

This allows us to send repeated commands easily to a ggobi instance.
\begin{verbatim}
> ggobi(args="../data/tes") 
> ggobi(args="../data/flea") #
> ggobi.getVariableNames()
[1] "tars1" "tars2" "head"  "aede1" "aede2" "aede3"
> setDefaultGGobi(1)
> ggobi.getVariableNames(.gobi=2)
\end{verbatim}
Additionally, commands intended for another can be directed without
setting that instance to the default.

By default, this is

instances in existence at any one time.
Each ggobi has its own


\subsection{getData}
Since the user can load data in a non-programmatic way, there is an
opportunity for XGobi to have data that has not been introduced to the
R/S session.  As a result, we need a mechanism to retrieve the current
values of the active data set.  This is especially important if we
allow the data to be edited in any way.

The return value is a matrix of numeric values containing the data
values.  The names of the rows and columns are the XGobi row labels
and variable names respectively.



\subsection{getColors}


\subsection{set}

\subsection{getGlyphs}


\subsection{getSelectedIndices}
This needs attention to access the correct
variable in the xgobi structure.


\subsection{getNumGGobis}
Returns the number of ggobi instances within this session.  Each ggobi
instance has its own data set. Of course, two instances may have the
same dataset, but they are independent.  We may allow them to be
linked in the future.  Again, the ability to specific which displays
and even plots within them inter- and intra- ggobi instance is most
useful in a programmatic interface.

\subsection{getDefaultGGobi}
Return the index of the currently active or default ggobi instance.
This is the ggobi instance which receives the commands by default.


\subsection{setDefaultGGobi}

\subsection{ggobi.getRowNames}
Returns the observation labels for
the specified ggobi instance.

See also \SFunction{ggobi.setRowNames}.

\subsection{getSmootherFunction.ggobi}
\subsection{ggobi}
This is the function that creates a ggobi instance.
One specifies the name of a file or a data frame (or matrix).
The newly created ggobi instance becomes the default

See \SFunction{setDefaultGGobi}

\subsection{ggobi.getActivePlot}
\subsection{ggobi.getCurrentDisplayType}
\subsection{ggobi.getDescription}
This gives a brief description of the specified ggobi instance.  This
gives the name of the file from which the data was read, the type of
file format (e.g. xml, ascii, binary) and the dimensions of the data.

See also \SFunction{getNumGGobis}.

\subsection{ggobi.getDisplayOptions}
This returns the current settings of the values that control how new
plots are displayed.  Each ggobi instance has a set of options which
are used to create new plots.  These are logical values that govern
the appearance of these plots.  This function returns a named vector
of those values currently in existence.



\subsection{ggobi.getDisplays}
Returns a list describing each display (or window) of plots within the
specified ggobi instance.  Each element in the list identifies a
display and gives the title of the window, the type of the plot(s)
contained in the display (since they are currently homogeneous) and a
list describing each of the plots.  The plot description depends on
the type of plot. Generally it contains a list of the variables within
that plot.  This is an integer vector giving the indeces of the
variables. The names of the elements in this vector are the names of
the variables. 


What about subsets in effect when the display was
created, etc.

\subsection{ggobi.getFileName}
Returns the name of the file
from which the data in ggobi
was read. If the data was explicitly
set from 

See also \SFunction{ggobi.getDescription}.

\subsection{ggobi.getGlyphs}
\subsection{ggobi.getSegments}
\subsection{ggobi.getVariableIndex}
\subsection{ggobi.getVariableNames}
\subsection{ggobi.getViewTypes}
\subsection{ggobi.parcoords}
\subsection{ggobi.scatmat}
\subsection{ggobi.scatterplot}
\subsection{ggobi.setActivePlot}
\subsection{ggobi.setData}
\subsection{ggobi.setDataFile}
\subsection{ggobi.setDataFrame}
This sets the dataset for the particular ggobi instance to the
contents of the dataframe.  Each column in the data frame corresponds
to an observations. The row names of the data frame are used as the
observation labels in the ggobi displays.

\subsection{ggobi.setDisplayOptions}
This controls the characteristics
of plots that are subsequently
created within the specified ggobi instance.
These control issues such as 
\begin{itemize}
\item whether lines are drawn, 
\item lines are directed or undirected
\item missing values are displayed,
\item grid lines are drawn on the plot(s),
\item axes are shown and/or centered,
\item double buffering is used,
\item the plot(s) are linked to others.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{ggobi.setRowNames}
This sets the observation identifiers for the 
specified rows in the ggobi instance dataset.
These are used in identifying points within 
plots.

The return value is a vector of the previous labels for the
specified rows/observations.

\subsection{setSmootherFunction.ggobi}




\subsection{ggobi.symbol}
This is of little or no interest to the regular user.  It is merely a
function that takes the name of a C routine and maps it to the name of
a routine in the GGobi chapter.  It does so by prefixing the name with
the ``unique'' identifier \Escape{RS_GGOBI} in an effort to avoid
symbol conflicts with other libraries.
