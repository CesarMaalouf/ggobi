<ggobidata count="1">

<!--
  There are two main elements in this file: one regular ggobi data
  element containing data corresponding to a set of polygons
  element and one polygondata element.

  We think it makes sense to separate the data to be read
  by the plugin from the data to be read by ggobi:  in
  particular, the polygon definitions themselves.

  In some cases, the "polypoints" that are used to define the
  polygons will be in here: in that case, the points will
  not be sensitive to brushing and identification and can not
  be plotted.  That makes sense for maps.

  In other cases, the polydata element will not have any 
  points, and the polygons will be defined in terms of points
  that exist in some ggobi data element.  (I'll put together
  polyexample.xml to show what that might look like.)

  These two cases may be represented by entirely different
  plugins, come to think of it, but we can still come up with
  a consistent way of defining them.

  polypoints usually live in 2D, but they may occasionally
  live in higher-dimensional spaces; in that sense, they may
  need variables.  They must specify an id.

  polygons may be nested, and because of that, they may need
  more than one categorical variable.
