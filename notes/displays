Assuming we had a display class, what methods should it have?

Drawing:

All splots in all displays plot points in the same way (so far);
most splots should to be able to add edges between points.

When an splot draws itself, it often checks the display type:
  when it decides whether to draw case i
  when it decides what plot labels to add
  whether to add other objects: if parcoords, add whiskers
  when it decides whether to draw a line differently:
     if parcoords, mark the current point by drawing its
     line with double thickness

When an splot manages its data, it checks the display type:
  it allocates different arrays for different display types
     parcoords: allocates, builds, frees whiskers
  projects the data differently 
  
Main UI:
  different viewmodes are available for different display types
  different display options are available for different display types
 
Variable gui:
  circles: this looks like a displaytype dependency, but it's really
    just a viewmode dependency, I think
  checkboxes: each display has its own variable selection rules

Variable table:
  finding out which variables are active works differently in
    each display type
