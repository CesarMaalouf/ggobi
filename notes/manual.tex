\begin{abstract}

The ggobi software is a data visualization system with state-of-the-art
interactive and dynamic methods for the manipulation of views of
data.  It represents a significant improvement on its precedessor, XGobi,
with multiple plotting windows, more flexible color management, XML file
handling, and better portability to Windows.

The most significant change may be that ggobi can be embedded in other
software and controlled using an API (application programming
interface).  This design has been developed and tested in partnership
with R.  When ggobi is used with R, the result is a full marriage
between ggobi's direct manipulation graphical environment and R's
familiar extensible environment for statistical data analysis.

It has the same graphical functionality whether it is running
standalone or embedded in other software.  That functionality
includes 2-D displays of projections of points and edges in
high-dimensional spaces, as well as scatterplot matrices, parallel
coordinate and time series plots.  Projection tools include average
shifted histograms of single variables, plots of pairs of variables,
and grand tours of multiple variables.  Views of the data can be
reshaped.  Points can be labeled and brushed with glyphs and colors.
Several displays can be open simultaneously and linked for labeling
and brushing.  Missing data are accommodated and their patterns can
be examined.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This paper gives an overview of the layout and functionality of ggobi,
interactive graphical software for exploratory data analysis.  Readers
who are familiar with xgobi will find much that is familiar in ggobi's
design, and might want to read section \ref{slbl:xgobi} first,
where key differences between the two programs are described.

You will find that you can use ggobi for simple tasks with virtually
no instruction.  All that a user needs is some cursory knowledge of
the developments in interactive statistical graphics of the last 15
years, as well as a willingness to experiment with the sample data
provided guided by the tooltips.  In parallel with the hands-on learning
process, it is probably useful to acquire a basic understanding of
the overall layout and functionality of the system.  The greatest
success is obtained by users who have gained experience with the
system and combine it with creativity and data analytic
sophistication.

We begin with a tutorial, and move on to describe ggobi in detail.

\section{Tutorial}

Several sample data files are included with the ggobi distribution, in
a directory called {\bf data,} and there you will find the file {\bf
olive.xml}, a dataset on olive oil samples from Italy \cite{FALT83}.
(This data set takes advantage of an XML input/output format, a
feature in ggobi that wasn't available in xgobi. It requires that
ggobi has been compiled with XML support. If ggobi has been compiled
without XML support, the set of files olive.dat, olive.col, olive.row,
similar to the xgobi data file input, can be used.) This data consists
of the percentage composition of 8 fatty acids (palmitic, palmitoleic,
stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, arachidic, eicosenoic) found in
the lipid fraction of 572 Italian olive oils. There are 9 collection
areas, 4 from southern Italy (North and South Apulia, Calabria,
Sicily), two from Sardinia (Inland and Coastal) and 3 from northern
Italy (Umbria, East and West Liguria).

Start ggobi for the olive oils data by typing:

\begin{quote}
ggobi olive
\end{quote}

Two windows will appear, the ggobi control panel and a scatterplot,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig1}.

The control panel has a panel of controls on the left, labeled {\bf
XYPlot}, and a variable selection region on the right.  You can see
that the scatterplot contains a 2-dimensional projection of the data,
a plot of Area vs Region.  Move the mouse to one of the variable labels
in the variable selection region, and leave it in place until the
tooltip appears, explaining how to select new variables for the
plot.   Begin to get a feeling for the data by looking at several of
the 2d plots:  Area vs palmitic, Region vs oleic....

\caption{Layout of a ggobi session.  The plotting window contains a
scatterplot of the Area vs Region, from the olive oils data.
}%}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Next, get acquainted with the main menubar for the control panel by
exploring each of its menus.  Pay particular attention to the
Display, ViewMode and Tools menus.

\begin {itemize}
\item The Display menu is the interface for opening new plotting
  windows.
\item The ViewMode menu is the interface for specifying both the
  projection (1d, 2d, 3d or higher) and mouse interactions (for scaling
  the plot, highlighting points, and so on) for the current plot.
\item The Tools menu lets you open other windows to manipulate
  characteristics of the data and the view.
\end {itemize}

Using the Display menu, open another scatterplot display. Notice that
the new window has a narrow white band drawn around the outside of
the plotting area:  that means that the new window is now the
``current display'' and its plot is the ``current plot.''  Click in the
plotting region of the other scatterplot to make it the current plot,
and notice what happens in the variable selection region of the
control panel when you alternate between the two:  it should always show
the variables that are plotted in the current plot.

Now set up a plot of linoleic vs eicosenoic in the first scatterplot,
and Area vs Region in the second, and make that the current plot.
Using the ViewMode menu, choose {\bf Identify}. Look at the buttons
inside the leftmost portion of the ggobi control panel. Notice that
they're contained by a frame labelled {\bf Identify,} which is the
ViewMode of the current plot.  This frame contains most of the row
labeling controls, which are described in the section
\ref{slbl:Identify}. Move the cursor around the plot window with mouse
movement, and observe the labels of the point closest to the cursor is
written. The labels for this data set were set as the geographic area
where the sample was taken.

Using the ViewMode menu, choose {\bf Brush.}  Look at the buttons and
menus inside the leftmost portion of the ggobi control panel.  Notice
that they're contained by a frame labelled {\bf Brush,} which is the
ViewMode of the current plot.  This frame contains most of the
brushing controls, which are described in the section
\ref{slbl:Brush}.  A few of the brushing controls, though, are in the
main menubar: in the Reset menu and at the bottom of the Options menu.

The rectangle that appears in the current plot is the ``paintbrush,''
and dragging it over points changes their color. Change the color of
the brush to, say, yellow, by opening up the {\bf Choose symbol} panel
(Figure \ref{fig2}). Now change the size of the brush.  Use the left
button to drag it and the middle or right button to resize it.  Make
it almost as tall as the window but very thin, and paint first the
region, then the second and third regions.  While you do that, keep an
eye on the plot of linoleic vs eicosenoic, and notice where the
painted points fall in that scatterplot (Figure \ref{fig3}.  Using two
linked 2d plots is one way to explore the relationship among three
variables.

\caption{Brushing in a ggobi session. Brushing Region 1 shows that it

}%}
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

Now change to {\bf Persistent} brushing and paint the 3 Regions
different colors. You may also want to use different symbols to
represent the different Areas. 

Next use the Tools menu to open the {\bf Variable manipulation} tool,
a central part of the ggobi graphical user interface (Figure
\ref{fig4}).  It contains a table with a few basic statistics for each
variable, and the buttons below the table allow you to set variable
limits, add new variables, and a few other things.  Try clicking the
mouse in the table -- you can select one row of the table at a time,
or use the control and shift keys as modifiers to select more than
one.  Hold the control key down while clicking to select variables
that are not contiguous in the table; use the shift key if you want to
select a contiguous range of variables. Select all of the fatty acid
variables. Now open up the {\bf Variable transformation} tool, and
choose {\bf Standardize} in the stage 2 transformation panel to
standardize all the variables to have mean 0 and variance 1. The
transformation tool has numerous transformation operations to perform
on variables as appropriate. Stage 0 is a domain adjustment operation
adjust variables values into an acceptable range as needed for some
stage 1 transformations. Stage 2 transformations allow for
post-processing of stage 1 transformations, so that the variables can
be logged and then standardized, for example.

\caption{Variable manipulation panel contains basic summary 
statistics of variables. It also is central to variable subset selection
for other modes.
}%}
\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

Now look at the plot of linoleic vs eicosenoic. Open up the {\bf Case
clusters ...} panel, and use the Hide/Show chack boxes to toggle
groups of points on and off (Figure \ref{fig5}). Hide the cases from
geographic region 1, and then {\bf Recale}. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\hbox{\pdfimage width 3in {olive-brush3.jpg}\pdfimage width 3in {olive-brush4.jpg}}
\caption{Toggling clusters of points on and off according to color/glyph value.}
\label{fig5}
\end{figure}

Now switch into {\bf 2D Tour} using the {\bf ViewMode} menu. The
variable checkboxes change to variable circles. Click on the circles
for Region adn Area to toggle these variables out of the tour. And
then click {\bf Reinit}. Also remove eicosenoic acid from the tour,
using similar mouse action. The scrollbar at the top of the tour
controls allows the speed of the tour to be adjusted. Drag it to the
right to speed up the rotation.  The circle in the bottom of the plot
window displays the axes for the tour. These can be toggled off the
plot by selecting the {\bf Options} menu on the plot window. Pause the
tour when you see a separation of the green and purple points, that
is, regions 2 and 3 (for example, Figure \ref{fig6}). Now you are
going to use manula tour controls to sharpen up the separation by
manually changing the coefficients of the variables in the
projection. On the main control window click on the {\bf Manip}
(purple) button, and then click on linoleic acid (a purple circle will
be seen now in the variable circle for linoleic acid). Now in the plot
window click and drag the cursor. The coefficent corresponding to
linoleic acid will increase and decrease inducing a rotation of the
scattercloud. Similarly rotate oleic acid and arachidic acid in and
out of the plot, with the aim to find a projection where the two
regions are better separated (for example, Figure \ref{fig6}).  There
are 5 choices of manipulation mode (unconstrained oblique, vertical,
horizontal, radial and angular) to explore.

\caption{Tour plots revealing difference between regions 2 and 3 of the
olive oils.}
\label{fig6}
\end{figure}

Now open up a {\bf New parallel coordinates display} using the {\bf
Display} menu. Using the {\bf Selection Mode:} menu on the control
panel select {\bf Delete} mode to remove Region and Area from the
parallel coordinates plot. Then switch to {\bf Append} mode and add
the remaining acid variables. Now select the first plot in the
parallel coordinates display by clicking on it, and using the {\bf
ViewMode} menu switch to {\bf Brush} mode. Choose a new color (say
yellow) and large closed glyph, and transiently paint the case with a
very low value on palmitic (Figure \ref{fig7}). This case also has a
very high value for oleic acid, and low value for linolenic acid.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\hbox{\pdfimage width 6in {olive-par.jpg}}
\caption{Brushing in a parallel coordinates display reveals and outlier in 
palmitic, oleic and linolenic acids.}
\label{fig7}
\end{figure}

Using the {\bf Case clusters} panel from the {\bf Brush} controls
click on the show check box to bring the Region 1 cases back into the
plot. Now using the {\bf File} menu output the data, saving the colors
and glyphs that have been created during this session.

This has been a brief introduction to the use of ggobi. The following
section contains more detailed information on the full functionality.

\section{Layout and functionality}

\subsection{The major functions}

Across the top of the control panel, as seen in in Figure 1,
stretches a row of buttons for selecting major ggobi functions from
pull-down menus.  Buttons such as {\bf File}, {\bf Display,} {\bf
ViewMode}, {\bf Tools}, {\bf Options} and {\bf DisplayTree} organize
functions in menus.

As expected, the {\bf File} button opens a menu for selecting
input/output functions as well as exiting.

The {\bf Display} button opens a manu for opening a new plotting
window.  The display types are
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em
\item scatterplot,
\item scatterplot matrix, 
\item parallel coordinates plot, and
\item time series plots.
\end{itemize}

If the data has missing values, a scatterplot or scatterplot matrix
of the ``missingness'' information can be opened.  Each display type
is discussed in section ~\ref{DisplayTypes}.

The {\bf ViewMode} menu contains links to ggobi's
inventory of interactive graphics operations: 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em
\item 1DPlot: 1-D dotplots and average shifted histograms,
\item XYPlot: 2-D scatterplots,
\item 1DTour: 1-D tour,
\item 2DTour: 2-D tour,
\item 2x1DTour: correlation tour, which is independent 1-D tours on horizontal and vertical axes, 
\item Scale: axis scaling,
\item Brush: setting point glyphs and point and edge colors,
\item Identify: labelling points
\item Move Points: direct manipulation of point positions.
\end{itemize}

When you choose a new view mode, the controls at the left of
the main window will change correspondingly:  each mode has its
own parameters, and its own rules for responding to mouse actions
in the plotting windows.  The view modes
are discussed in section~\ref{slbl:ViewModes}.

The {\bf Tools} menu gives access to 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em
\item a variable manipulation table,
\item a variable transformation pipeline,
\item an variable sphering panel,
\item jittering controls,
\item a panel for hiding groups of cases,
\item subsetting functions for systematic and random subsampling, 
\item a tool for managing missing values.
\end{itemize}

Each tool is discussed in section ~\ref{Tools}.

There are a couple of distinctions between view modes and tools
The view mode functions determine the mouse interactions in the
display windows, while none of the Tools does.  Furthermore,
view mode functions populate the control panel in the main ggobi
window, while tools create their own permanent control panels
or views of the data in separate windows, as shown in figure~?.  For
example, the {\bf variable manipulation tool} is a window containing
a table of data each variable and several buttons, and the {\bf
variable transformation tool} is also a separate window.

The {\bf Options} menu allows users to set some options for the
main control window:  whether tooltips are displayed, for instance,
and whether the control panel is shown.  In some view modes, it contains
additional options that are specific to that mode.

Other menus are present only during certain modes:  you will
sometimes find an {\bf I/O} menu or a {\bf Reset} menu.

The {\bf DisplayTree} menu allows users to open a tree listing
all the currently open display windows, each of which may contain
several plots.

\subsection{Graphical displays}
\label{slbl:GraphicalDisplays}

\subsubsection{Current display, current plot}

Since there are multiple displays, some of which contain multiple
plots, the question arises:  Which plot in which display window
corresponds to the control panel?  If you select the {\bf Brush} mode,
how can you tell which plot is going to respond to
brushing?

There is in ggobi a notion of the ``current display'' and the
``current plot.''  (We need both because some displays, like the
scatterplot matrix, contain multiple plots.) The current plot is the
one which is outlined with a thick white border; the current display
is the one which contains the current plot.

To reset the current plot and display, just click once (left, right
or middle) in the plot you wish to address.  To understand the
effects of this selection, open a few displays and set them in
different ViewModes, then click on different plots and see what
happens.  The white border should follow your actions, and the
control panel should update so that its panels correspond to the
current display type and ViewMode.

\subsubsection{Display types}
\label{DisplayTypes}

Each display type is briefly described here. 
As mentioned earlier, there are presently four main display types:

The {\bf scatterplot} display is a window containing a single
scatterplot.  By default, it includes axes; they can be turned off
using the Options menu in the main control window.  It has the
largest number of view modes of any display, and each of the
projection modes has its own rules for variable selection.  The
variable selection interface for the 1DPlot and XYPlot modes is a
column of checkboxes: clicking left on one of these selects a
variable to be plotted horizontally, clicking middle or right selects
a vertical variable.  The tour modes all use a set of labelled
circles for variable selection, and they provide some feedback about
current projection.  The variable selection behavior for the tour
modes will be described in the section for each mode.

The {\bf scatterplot matrix} is a window containing a symmetric matrix
of scatterplots for the chosen variables.  The plots along the diagonal
are ASHes (Average Shifted Histograms).  The matrix is required to be
symmetric, and that constraint affects its variable selection behavior.

\begin{itemize}
\item Replace:  First select one of the plots along the diagonal
  to tell ggobi uniquely which variable to replace, then click on
  one of the checkboxes in the variable selection region.
\item Insert (Append):  First select one of the plots along the
  diagonal to tell ggobi uniquely where to insert (append) the new
  variable, then click on one of the variable checkboxes.  (For now,
  ggobi will not add a variable that's already plotted.)
\item Delete:  No plot selection is required; just click on the
  variable you want to delete.
\end{itemize}

The {\bf parallel coordinates} display contains a single parallel
coordinates plot, which can be arranged horizontally or vertically.
(To understand this plot if you are encountering it for the first time, 
imagine deconstructing a high-dimensional scatterplot and arranging
its axes in parallel instead of orthogonally.  To represent case $i$,
think of drawing a dot on axis $j$ at that point's value for variable
$j$, and then connecting the dots into one set of connected line segments.
For a more detailed explanation, see [].)  The line segments are drawn
by default, but you can turn them off using the {\bf Options} menu
on the display menubar.

By default, the plots are simple dotplots, but they can also be drawn
using one of the other two methods for 1D plots:  as a textured dot
strip or an ASH.

The variable selection behavior works as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Replace:  First select one of the plots, then click on one
  of the variable checkboxes to replace its plotted variable.
\item Insert (Append):  First select one of the plots, then click on
  one of the variable checkboxes to insert (append) a new plot.  (For
  now, ggobi will not add a variable that's already plotted.)
\item Delete:  No plot selection is required; just click on the
  variable whose plot you want to delete.
\end{itemize}

The {\bf time series display} contains a row or column of 2-variable
plots with a common axis, usually a time variable.  By default, the
points are connected with line segments.  

The time series display uses the checkbox variable selection interface,
and the behavior of the checkboxes depends on the state of the
{\bf Selection mode} option menu in the control panel.

\begin{itemize}
\item Replace: If you want to replace the horizontal (time) variable,
  no plot selection is required; simply click left on the variable you
  want to choose.  To replace a vertical variable, first select the
  plot you want to change, and then click right or middle on the
  variable you want.  (For now, ggobi won't let you use a variable
  that's already plotted.)
\item Insert (Append):  Select a plot in the display, and then click
  middle or right on a variable checkbox.  (This applies to
  verticallly plotted variable only.)
\item Delete: No plot selection is required; just click middle or
  right on the variable checkbox for the variable you want to
  delete.  (This applies to verticallly plotted variable only.)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Missing values displays}
\label{slbl:MissingData}

When your data includes missing values, two additional display types
are available.  The missing values scatterplot and scatterplot matrix
display not the data itself but the ``missingness'' for each point, namely
a jittered scatterplot of indicator variables encoding the presence or
absence of values for each variable.  Examining a number of views in one
of these displays allows us to explore the joint distribution of missing
values across variables.  Since these displays are linked to all others,
brushing the missings in a missing values display allows us to explore
the association between missing values and the variables.

\section{Data format}
\label{slbl:DataFormat}

\subsection {ASCII}
\label{slbl:ASCII}

The basics of the ascii data format used in xgobi are still supported, with
some changes.

The only essential file is the one containing the data itself.  Each
line in the file contains one row of the input data matrix, and lines
must be separated by carriage returns.  Columns, or variables, can be
separated by any number of tabs or spaces.  The file can have the
suffix {\em .dat}, but no suffix is required, so it is named either
{\bf filename.dat} or just {\em filename}.

You can supply variable and case labels in associated files.
Variable (column) labels can be in a file named {\bf datafile.col}
(or {\bf datafile.column}, {\bf datafile.collab}, or {\bf
datafile.var}).  Case (row) labels can be supplied in a file named
{\bf datafile.row} (or {\bf data\-file.row\-lab} or {\bf
data\-file.case}).  There should be one label per line, and the label
can include blanks.  If variable or case labels are not supplied,
default labels using column or row numbers are used.

The files {\bf datafile.glyphs} and {\bf datafile.colors} can be
used to set the plotting characters and colors to be used in
drawing each point.  Glyphs can be specified in two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item with a string for glyph type and a number for glyph size, where
the string is one of ``plus'', ``x'', ``or'' (open rectangle), ``fr''
(filled rectangle), ``oc'' (open circle), ``fc'' (filled circle),
``.'' (a one-pixel point), and the number is between 1 and 8, or
\item with one number per line, where the number is between one and
49.  Here's how to generate that number: the type is between 1 and 7,
using the ordering just presented, and the size is between 1 and 8
(though it must be 1 for the single-pixel glyph).  The number is then
$8 \times (type-1) + size$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {XML}
\label{slbl:XML}

The XML format is described in {\em Using XML Input Formats},
which you should find where you found this manual.  The XML format
allows more detailed specification, such as

\begin{itemize}
\item multiple datasets within a single process,
\item rules for linking between datasets,
\item edges: line segments connecting pairs of points, and
\item the colormap to be used in brushing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Database access}
\label{slbl:MySQL}

\section{Integration of ggobi with other software systems}
\label{slbl:Integration}

\section{View modes: projection and interaction}
\label{slbl:ViewModes}

Selecting any mode on the {\bf ViewMode} menu changes the interactions
available for the display and plot that are current, and pops the
corresponding control panel into the left portion of the main control
window.  The modes in the top half of the menu do something more as
well:  they set the projection method for the display, and the meaning
of actions in the variable selection panel always conforms to the current
projection method.

As an example, start ggobi with some data, and watch what happens
in the main ggobi window and a a single scatterplot display.   When ggobi
starts, it's in {\bf XYPlot} mode by default, so the scatterplot window shows
a 2-dimensional projection of the data.  If you select {\bf Scale} or
{\bf Brush} (or any choice in the bottom half of the menu), the control
panel at the left of the main window changes, reflecting the different
interactions available to you in each mode.  However, the projection in
the window doesn't change.  If you click on the checkboxes in the
variable selection panel at the right of the main ggobi window, you
replace one of the plotted variables.

Now select {\em 2D Tour} in the ViewMode menu.  {\em Everything}
changes at once, because you've effectively selected both a new mode and
a new projection type at the same time.
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em
\item The control panel changes, because a new set of interactions
      just became available.
\item The variable selection panel changes, because the variable
      selection behavior for high-dimensional projection types is
      quite different than that for low-dimensional projection types.
\item The plot in the scatterplot display changes, because it's
      now showing a projection of 3 variables instead of 2.  Furthermore,
      it's moving, because a grand tour process is running.
\end{itemize}

If you now select one of the modes in the bottom half of the ViewMode
menu, you'll see again that the variable selection panel doesn't
change, and the plot in the scatterplot doesn't change -- except
that it stops moving.  The only thing that changes with every
selection is the control panel at the left of the main window.

Now we'll describe each view mode in more detail, starting at the
top of the ViewMode menu. 

\subsection{1D plots}

The 1D plots can be displayed in two ways:  as a textured dot plot
or an average shifted histogram.

The textured dot plot uses a method (and code) created by Tukey and Tukey
\cite{TukeyTukey90TM}.  The method spreads the data laterally by
amounts that are partly constrained and partly random, resulting in a
fairly smooth spreading of the points and minimizing artifacts of the
plotting method, such as stripes, clusters, or gaps.

The average shifted histogram is due to Scott \cite{Scott92},
and the code is also his.  In this method, several histograms are
calculated using the same binwidth but different origins, and the
averaged results are plotted.  The smoothing parameter essentially
controls the binwidth.

The 1D plot will be arranged horizontally if you select a variable
with a left click, and vertically if you use a middle or right click.

\subsection{XY plots}

\subsection{1D Tour}
\label{slbl:1DTour}

The 1D tour generates a continuous sequence of 1-D projections of the
active variable space. The projected data are displayed as an average
shifted histogram, horizontally or vertically. The scrollbar at the
top of the controls allows the speed of rotation to be adjusted. The
pause checkbox stops and starts the tour. Reinit initializes the tour
to the projection of the first active variable. A rudimentary guided
tour is available from the projection pursuit control panel. Currently
only the principal component index is implemented.

Variables can be toggled into the tour by clicking on the variable
circles. The active variable space is the subset of variables
currently entered into a tour. When a variable is toggled out of the
tour it fades out gradually, to maintain continuity of the tour.

The variable projection coefficients can be manually manipulated using
manual controls. To select the variable to manipulate, click on the
purple {\bf Manip} button and then click on the variable circle. Then
using mouse motion in the plot window the coefficient for the
manipulation variable can be altered, constrained by the values of the
coefficients of other active variables.

The variable axes can be toggled on or off using the options menu at
the top of the plot window.

\subsection{2D Tour}
\label{slbl:2DTour}

The 2D tour generates a continuous sequence of 2-D projections of the
active variable space. The projected data are displayed as a
scatterplot. The scrollbar at the top of the controls allows the speed
of rotation to be adjusted. The pause checkbox stops and starts the
tour. Reinit initializes the tour to the projection of the first two
active variables. A rudimentary guided tour is available from the
projection pursuit control panel. Currently only the holes and central
mass indices are implemented.

Variables can be toggled into the tour by clicking on the variable
circles. The active variable space is the subset of variables
currently entered into a tour. When a variable is toggled out of the
tour it fades out gradually, to maintain continuity of the tour.

The variable projection coefficients can be manually manipulated using
manual controls. To select the variable to manipulate, click on the
purple {\bf Manip} button and then click on the variable circle. Then
using mouse motion in the plot window the coefficient for the
manipulation variable can be altered, constrained by the values of the
coefficients of other active variables. There are 5 manipulation
modes: oblique is unconstrained manipulation, horizontal and vertical
constrain manipulation along the axes, radial constrains manipulation
to the current direction of the variable keeping angle fixed, and
angular manipulation allows rotating the variable axis in the plane of
the plot window, keeping the length of the axis fixed.

The variable axes can be toggled on or off using the options menu at
the top of the plot window.

\subsection{2x1D Tour}
\label{slbl:2x1DTour}

The 1x1D tour generates 2 independent continuous sequences of 1D
projections of 2 active variable spaces, plotting the results
horizontally and vertically generating a scatterplot. The scrollbar at
the top of the controls allows the speed of rotation to be
adjusted. The pause checkbox stops and starts the tour. Reinit
initializes the tour to the projection of the first two active
variables.

Variables can be toggled into the tour by clicking on the variable
circles. A click with the left mouse toggles a variable in the
horizontal direction, and a click with the middle mouse toggles a
variable in the vertical direction. The active variable space is the
subset of variables currently entered into a tour. When a variable is
toggled out of the tour it fades out gradually, to maintain continuity
of the tour.

The variable projection coefficients can be manually manipulated using
manual controls. To select the variable to manipulate, click on the
purple {\bf Manip} button and then click on the variable circle. Then
using mouse motion in the plot window the coefficient for the
manipulation variable can be altered, constrained by the values of the
coefficients of other active variables. There are 4 manipulation
modes: combined is changes both horizontal and vertical manipulation
variable coefficients, equal combined constrains the horizontal and
vertical changes to be equal, horizontal and vertical constrain
manipulation along the axes.

The variable axes can be toggled on or off using the options menu at
the top of the plot window.

\subsection{Scaling of axes}
\label{slbl:Scaling}

The two styles of interaction, {\bf Drag} and {\bf Click}, are quite
different.  Drag-style scaling is a perfect example of a direct
manipulation interface, in which the points follow cursor motion in a
very simple way.  However, if you're looking at a lot of data, the
points may sometimes lay behind the cursor motion, making the degree
of panning or zooming hard to control.

Click-style scaling may take you a few minutes to get used to, but
you'll find that it gives you very precise control and is especially
useful when you have a lot of data.

\subsubsection{Drag}

For the default setting, Drag, the actions of the mouse can be
described in terms of a camera:  you're operating a camera and
looking at a projection of the data in the viewfinder.  When you use
the left button, the camera is panning freely around, following the
mouse exactly.  When you use the middle or right button, you're
zooming the camera in and out.

\subsubsection{Click}

When you select the Click interaction style, the manipulation is
not so direct, but your control of the panning and zooming becomes
more precise.

With {\bf Pan} selected, the mouse controls the endpoint of a line
segment which is anchored at the center of the plot (just where the
center of the crosshair is in Drag style).  When you press the space
bar, you'll cause the plot to pan so that the endpoint becomes the
new center -- ie, short segments yield small movements.  Repeated
presses repeat the motion in the same direction -- convenient for
browsing time-dependent data, for instance.

With {\bf Zoom} selected, the visual guide changes again:  this time,
the mouse controls a rectangle, and two keys are used:  ``<'' to
zoom in and ``>'' to zoom out an amount inversely proportional to the size
of the rectangle -- ie, large rectangles yield small movements.

\subsubsection{Reset}

To reset the plot, use the menu marked Reset in the main menubar:
it has two entries, allowing pan and zoom to be reset separately.

\subsubsection{Pan and zoom options}

By the default, the panning and zooming of the plot is unconstrained,
moving or rescaling vertically and horizontally with each action.
The pan and zoom options allow it to be constrained so that only
one axis is affected, convenient for browsing one variable at a time.

\subsection{Brush: brushing of points and edges}
\label{slbl:Brush}

Brushing is often performed when only a single display is visible,
but it is most interesting and useful to perform brushing with more
than one linked display showing different views of the same data.  

To interactively paint points, drag left to move the ``brush'' within
the plotting window, or drag middle to change the size or shape of
the brush while you paint.  (If you lose the brush by pulling it
outside the plotting window, you can grab it again if you press the
left or middle button while the cursor is inside the display window.)

\subsubsection{Brush On}
%
When the {\bf Brush on} toggle is checked, moving the brush
over a plotted point causes that point to change its color or
plotting character (called a glyph).  If the brush is turned off, the
brush can be freely moved across the plotting window and it does not
change the points.  

This is useful if you are plotting a very large number of points,
and you want to position the brush before painting, because you
can move it much more quickly across the plot.  [This isn't true
in the default mode, where the brush jumps to the cursor.  Shall
I re-add the other mode?]

\subsubsection{Points and edges}
%
If {\bf Points} is selected, the brush is drawn as a rectangle.  As
the brush is moved across the points, any points contained by the
brush are redrawn using the currently selected glyph and color.  If
{\bf Edges} is selected, the brush is drawn as a crosshair, and as
the brush is moved in the window, any edges (line segments)
intersecting either the vertical or horizontal ``hair'' are redrawn
in the chosen color.  (There is no edge brushing implementation for
edge types yet.) If both {\bf Points} and {\bf Edges} are selected,
the brush is drawn as a crosshair inside a rectangle, and both point
and edge brushing are performed.

\subsubsection{Color and glyph}
%
Use the {\bf Color and glyph} menu to choose whether to brush
with color, glyph, or both, or whether to hide the points you
paint.

\subsubsection{Brushing modes:  persistent, transient}
%
These are two brushing modes.
\medskip
\noindent
\\{\bf Persistent}:  When you brush a point, it retains its new color or glyph
  when the brush has moved away.
\\{\bf Transient}:  As the brush moves off a point, it returns to the color and
  glyph it had before the brush covered it.

\subsubsection{Undo}
%
Clicking on the {\bf Undo} button restores the glyph and color and
visibility of all points painted between the last mouse-down and
mouse-up.

\subsubsection{Options menu}
%
When the brushing mode is active, the Options menu in the main
menu bar contains this item:
\medskip
\noindent
\\{\bf Update brushing continuously}: Update linked
  brushing with every mouse motion.  The alternative is to update linked
  views only when the mouse is released.

\subsubsection{Reset menu}
%
When the brushing mode is active, the Reset Menu in the main
menu bar contains these items:

\begin{tabbing}
 {\bf Show all points} \hspace{.5in} \= Make all points visible. \\
%{\bf Reset point colors} \> Restore all points to the default color. \\
%{\bf Reset glyphs} \> Restore all points to the default glyph. \\
 {\bf Show all edges} \> Make all edges visible. \\
%{\bf Reset edge colors} \> Restore all edges to the default color. \\
 {\bf Reset brush size} \> Reset the brush to its default size and position. \\
\end{tabbing}
%

\subsection{Identification}
\label{slbl:Identify}

This mode is used to display labels near points in the plotting
window.  The labels are taken from the file of row or case labels
supplied by the user; if the file is not present, the row number of
each case is used.  To see these labels, simply move the cursor
inside the plotting window.  The label of the point nearest the
cursor is displayed.

Identification in one window is instantly reflected in all linked windows.

To cause a label to become ``sticky,'' click left when the target
label is printed.  The printing style changes and the label now
remains printed as the cursor moves off, and even remains printed as
you leave the {\bf Identify} mode.  It is possible to rescale or
rotate data, and the sticky labels will continue to be printed next
to their associated points.

To cause a label to become ``unsticky,'' return to the {\bf Identify}
mode and click left again when the target point is nearest the
cursor.  It is also possible to restore all labels to unsticky status
by clicking on the {\bf Remove labels} button.  You can also see all
the labels at once by clicking on {\bf Make all sticky}.

\subsection{Edge editing}

Not implemented.

\section{Tools}
\label{Tools}

\subsection{Variable manipulation tool}
\label{slbl:VarManip}

This powerful tool is opened by selecting the first entry on the
{\bf Tools} menu.  It has several important functions:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep 0em
\item the display of variable statistics,
\item variable selection for other tools,
\item setting variable ranges,
\item cloning variables, and
\item adding other new variables.
\end{itemize}

Its first purpose is to display a few statistics for each variable:
the current variable transformation (if any); the minimum, maximum,
mean, and median of the raw data; the number of missing values per variable.

You can also use it to select variables -- not for plotting, but to
be operated on by other tools.  Variables are selected by highlighting
rows, and the control and shift keys are modifiers that allow multiple
rows to be highlighted.  The variable transformation tool, among
others, will operate on the variables selected in this way.

These selected variables will also respond to operations contained
within this panel:  you can reset the variable ranges that are used
for projecting the data into the plotting window.  This is especially
useful for a data set where several of the variables have the same units.

The selected variables can also be cloned, and the new variables
you create will be added to the table as well as the main control panel.

\label{NewVariable}
There's another way to add new variables, and that relies on the {\em New
...} button, which brings up a small panel.  Use that panel to specify
the variable's name and to set its values:  either the row numbers or
a set of integers reflecting the groups currently defined by brushing.

\subsection{Variable transformation tool}
\label{slbl:VarTransform}

The first step in variable transformation is to specify the variables
you want to transform.  By default, the variables plotted in the
current display will be affected; if you wish to select others, use
the {\bf Variable manipulation tool.}

There are three stages in the transformation pipeline, with a
transformation function in each stage operating on the output of the
previous stage.  It's equally acceptable to use any or all of them.

You can think of stage 0 as a domain adjustment stage:  if a variable
has negative values, for instance, many transformation functions
can't be applied to it, so you may need to add an increment to each
value.  The transformations in the next two stages don't have such
neat definitions. 

Stage 1 transformations include the Box-Cox family of linear
transformations \( T(X)~=~(X ^ \lambda - 1) / \lambda\) \cite{BoxCox64},
and you can either type the Box-Cox parameter into
the text box and hit return, or use the spin button to gradually
increase or decrease the parameter. 

Many of the stage 2
transformations are not linear; they include sorting and ranking.

\subsection{Sphering}
\label{slbl:Sphering}

The {\em Sphering} panel starts by displaying a scree plot for the
currently selected variables (see section \ref{slbl:VarManip}).  If the
scree plot doesn't reflect the variables you want to sphere, then open
the Variable statistics panel, select the variables of interest, and
click on {\em Update scree plot}.

It's advisable to standardize the variables first, so a label at the top
of the panel reminds you if they aren't.  In that case, open the {\em
Variable transformation} tool and standardize the selected variables,
then click {\em Update scree plot.}

Now you're ready to sphere the selected variables.  Working your way down
the panel, use your visual interpretation of the scree plot together
with the information in the labelled section ``Prepare to sphere'' to
decide how many principal components you want to create.  By default,
all the selected variables will be sphered, but you decide that the first
few principal components account for a sufficiently high proportion of
the variance.  In that case, you can use the spin button to the right
of the label ``Set number of PCs'' to decrease the number of principal
components you're going to generate.  The variance and condition number
are displayed to help you make that choice.

Once you're satisfied with the selected variables and the number of
principal components, proceed to the last step.  Click on {\em Apply
sphering} to create new variables and add them ggobi's variable selection
panels.  The names of the selected variables will be added to the
``sphered variables'' to help you remember which variables you sphered.

Restore scree plot can be used to refresh the plot when a new subset
of variables is chosen.

\subsection{Inference}

Not implemented.

\subsection{Jittering}

Select {\em Variable jittering ...} to open a panel that allows
random noise to be added to selected variables.  This ameliorates
overplotting in scatterplots of data with many ties.

First specify the variables you wish to jitter.  By default, the
variables plotted in the current display will be affected; if you
wish to select others, use the {\bf Variable manipulation tool.}

Choose between uniform and normal random jitter, and then set the degree of
jitter using the slider.  To rejitter without changing the degree of
jitter, simply click on the {\bf Jitter} button.

\subsection{Case clusters}

The case clusters tool displays a table.  Each unique
symbol in the data (combination of color and clyph) occupies
a row, and for each row there are three buttons:  {\bf H}
hides all points drawn in the chosen symbol, {\bf S} shows
them all, and {\bf C} hides what's shown and shows what's
hidden.  The three remaining columns report the number of
cases hidden, the number shown, and the sum.

The {\bf Update} button at the bottom of the window will reset
the contents of the table in case it isn't responding to changes
in the displays.  The {\bf Rescale} button will cause the views
to be redrawn as if any hidden points are no longer in the data:
that is, the points that are shown will be scaled to fill the
viewing area of the plot.

See \ref{NewVariable} to read how you can add a new variable to the
existing data which serves as an indicator for these ``clusters.''

\subsection{Subsetting}

Select {\em Case subsetting and sampling ...} to open a panel
that allows subsets to be specified in one of five ways.

{\bf Random sample without replacement}:  Specify the number of
cases to be in the sample.
\\{\bf Consecutive block}:  Specify the first and last row of the block.
\\{\bf Every nth case}:  Specify the interval and the first row.
\\{\bf Sticky labels}:  All cases with a ``sticky'' label will
  be in the subset.  (See {\em Identification} for a description
  of sticky labels.)
\\{\bf Row labels}: Type in a row label, and all cases with that
  label will be in the subset.

Select one of those five, then click on {\bf Subset} in the
bottom row of the panel.  If you want to re-include all rows, 
select the {\bf Include all} button in the bottom row.

If the {\bf Rescale} button is checked, then the plots will be
rescaled to exclude all points not in the subset.  If it is
not checked, the points will be hidden but not excluded from
plot scaling operations.

One purpose of subsetting is to allow the use of ggobi on data matrices
that are so large that dynamic and interactive operations begin to
become painfully slow.  By selecting a smaller subset, a user can
work on that subset at a comfortable speed of rotation and
interaction.  Another purpose is to do graphical cross-validation:
if the feature you see is still there in repeated subsamples, there's
a good chance it's not just an artifact of visualization.

\subsection{Controls for missing data}
%
By default, missing values are assigned the value $0$, but you
may sometimes find that to be an inconvenient choice.  Use the
{\em Missing values} panel to assign alternative numbers.

By default, all missings in all variables will be affected
together, but you can choose to assign values only for selected
variables using the menu at the top of the panel.

Below the menu, a notebook widget allows you to specify the
type of imputation you'd like to use.

{\bf Random imputation}: Sample from the present values for each variable
  to populate the missing values.  If you have done some brushing to
  partition the cases, you can specify that you want the sampling to be
  done using only cases brushed with the same color and glyph.
\\{\bf Fixed value}: Specify any value to use instead of the default.
\\{\bf Percentage below minimum}: Specify a value that is $x$ percent
  below the minimum value.  For example, if the variable ranges from
 $40$ to $80$, specifying 10 will assign the missings the value $40 - (10\%
 * 40) = 36$.
\\{\bf Percentage above minimum}: Specify a value that is $x$ percent
above the maximum.

If you want all plots to rescale immediately when you assign new
values, turn on {\em Rescale} toggle.  Finally, click on the {\em Impute}
button to perform the imputation or assignment of values.

\section{Multiple datasets}

\section{Linking}
\label{LinkingRules}

If two display windows represent the same dataset, then points which
represent the same case are linked:  that is, they are drawn with the
same symbol (color and glyph), and if a case is labelled in one
display, it will be identically labelled in all displays.

If the ggobi process has multiple datasets, then the linking rules
have been defined in the XML file (or through the API).

1.  If you have specified a categorical variable to use for linking,
then all datasets with a variable of the same name are affected, and
all cases which have the same level of that variable are linked.
(The labels for the levels aren't used in that determination, just
the numerical representation of the level.)

2.  If you are not using a categorical variable for linking, then
cases are linked by {\bf id}: if two cases share the same {\bf id},
then they are linked.   Ids are unique within a dataset.  If you have
not specifically assigned an id to a case, then it doesn't have one.

This is described in more detail in the XML documentation.

\section{Differences from xgobi}
\label{slbl:xgobi}

In this section, we summarize the key differences between ggobi
and xgobi for those readers who are already familiar with xgobi.

\subsection {Multiple displays}

The first thing you'll notice when you look at a ggobi display is
that the plotting window has become separated from the control
panels.  The main reason for that change is so that a ggobi process
can have multiple display windows, of the same type or of different
types.  In addition to the basic scatterplot, ggobi currently has
scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinates plots, and time series
plots.  (See \ref{slbl:GraphicalDisplays} for more detail.)

This design change has had far-reaching effects.

First, user interactions available for the simple scatterplot display
can now be made available for other display types.  In xgobi, for
instance, there is a parallel coordinates display, but it's not
possible to brush it -- in ggobi, it is. 

Unfortunately, having multiple displays introduces a new source of
ambiguity: you now have to tell ggobi which display, and which plot
within a display, you want to address.  Do that by simply clicking
inside the target plot.  ggobi will draw a thick white outline around
that plot so that you can check which plot your actions will be
addressing.  The ViewMode panel in the main ggobi window should
always correspond to the state of the current display, too.  We need
more user experience before we can tell whether this approach is
satisfactory.

The basis for linking has changed, too:  since all displays are
linked by default, it's no longer necessary to run multiple processes
in order to achieve linked displays.

One of the most interesting implications of using multiple displays
is that a ggobi process is no longer restricted to a single data
set.  The XML file format makes it easy to specify two or more data
matrices in a single file, as described in section \ref{slbl:XML}.
In addition, it's possible to add data matrices using the Read button
on the File menu or using R.  (The R~-~ggobi interface will be
introduced below, and it's more fully described in section
\ref{slbl:Integration}.)

The rules and the interface for linking across data sets have not yet
been defined.

With multiple displays, too, we no longer have to launch a new
process to open missing value plots -- the plots of 1's and 0's
which represent the presence and absence of data in each cell.

A convenient side effect of multiple displays is that, since each
display now sits in a window of its own, it's now very simple to
adjust the aspect ratio of a plot; this simple operation is very
awkward in xgobi.

\subsection {Data format}

Before we describe other key changes in the visible design, we'll
introduce the changes in data format.  The xgobi format, in which a
set of files with a common base name is used, is still supported,
though some file formats have changed ({\em .colors}), and some are
no longer supported ({\em .bin}, {\em .vgroups}, {\em .lines}). 
(See section \ref{slbl:DataFormat} for more detail.)

The new format, in which all the data lives in one file, is written
in XML.  XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a widely used language
for specifying structured documents and data to be viewed and
exchanged.  It was initially intended to be read by browsers, but it
is also used to define documents that are read by other software.
XML files can be validated automatically, and XML specifications can
be easily extended, too, by adding to the set of tags in use.

As ggobi grows and develops, we expect to favor the XML format:  it
will become increasingly difficult to keep the old format up to
date.  For instance, it's no longer possible to specify edges
in the ascii data format, but they can be specified in XML -- and
they can have associated data values.

A few XML data files are included in the sample ggobi data, and
the details of their format is described in ??.

Another innovation in data access is the ability to read data
directly from a MySQL database, as described in section \ref{slbl:MySQL}.

\subsection{Integration}

Many xgobi users are also users of the SPlus or R statistics
software, and have used the S function which launches an xgobi
process viewing S data.  Once that launch occurred, the resulting
process was utterly independent of its parent.  The xgobi authors
did some experiments in the early 90s to achieve a more intimate
connection, but made little headway.  (reference)

With ggobi, that problem has been solved, and it's now possible
to have real-time integration between ggobi and a variety of
other software environments.  An example of this integration is
the embedding of ggobi into R (or S), with the addition of a set of
R (or S) functions that manipulate ggobi data and displays,
resetting data values, projection, and the appearance of the plot.

For more details, see section \ref{slbl:Integration}, or read
(reference).

\subsection {Variable selection}

There have been a few changes in variable selection.  The
familiar variable circles are still used for high-dimensional
view modes, but we've switched to a simple checkbox interface
for plots where only one or two variables can be selected
simultaneously.  In these plots, the rich feedback provided
by the variable circles is not needed, and may just be confusing
to novices.

The basics of the user interface haven't changed, though:
click with the left button to select a variable to be plotted
horizontally and the middle (or right) button to plot vertically.

\subsection {The variable manipulation tool}

The table in the {\bf Variable manipulation tool} can also be used to
select variables -- not for plotting, but to be operated on by other
tools.  Several of the tools, such as variable transformation and
jittering, will operate on the plotted variables in the current
display by default.  However, if any rows in this table are
highlighted, then all selected variables will be affected.

This table can also be used to specify limits for variables or groups
of variables, and so we have dispensed with the {\em .vgroups}
functionality in xgobi.

Variable cloning is another new feature: it appears as a button
on the variable selection and statistics table.

For more detail on this table, see section \ref{slbl:VarManip}.

\subsection{Changes in ViewModes and Tools}

{\bf Brush} may be the {\bf ViewMode} that has changed the most,
because ggobi has a much richer notion of color selection than
xgobi.  Open the {\bf Choose Symbol} panel, and then double-click on
any element of the color palette to bring up a color selection widget
with access to the full color map.  Notice that you can change the
background color as well as any of the foreground colors.

{\bf Scale} has also changed.  The direct manipulation shifting and
scaling methods work as they did in xgobi, but we've added  what we
call ``Click-style interaction'' for more precise control.  See section
\ref{slbl:Scaling}.

The tour methods in ggobi are still evolving:  many things are not
yet implemented, such as projection pursuit, but new things are
beginning to appear.  In the {\bf 1DTour}, a projection of several
variables is viewed an an average shifted histogram, as described
in section \ref{slbl:1DTour}.

The redesign of the tour methods is reflected in the {\bf Sphering}
tool, which also appears in the most recent versions of xgobi.
Instead of automatically sphering variables in projection pursuit,
ggobi allows you the choice:  you can use the {\bf Sphering} tool to
decide which variables to sphere.  Since this method makes use of
variable cloning, it creates new variables, allowing you to look at
plots of principal components against the original data.

See section \ref{slbl:Sphering} for details and pictures.

\subsection{Linking}

The rules for linking in xgobi had evolved into a rather complicated
hodge-podge with special handling of ``row groups,'' the
``nlinkable'' notion to exclude points from linking, and linking
points to line segments (edges).  This has been replaced with a single set
of rules that can be specified in the xml file.  See section 
\ref{LinkingRules} for details.

\subsection{On-line help}

The on-line help system used in xgobi has been replaced with
``tooltips,'' so leaving the mouse over a widget for a couple of
seconds brings up a phrase describing the function of that widget.
If the tooltips annoy you, you can turn then off using a
checkbox on the {\bf Options} menu.
