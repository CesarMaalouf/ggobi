<!--
  In this example, the points that define the polygons do
  exist as data points in ggobi.  This may be because we have
  data on the nodes, or it may just be because we want to have
  the points available for brushing.

  An id must be specified in the datad.

  How will the polygon viewer which variables from the data element
  to use in constructing the polygons?  By default, it will use the
  first two variables; it will be possible to choose other variables
  or more variables.

  Just for the heck of it, add a second datad consisting of
  variables corresponding to each polygon.

  A thought:  I wonder if this would allow us to explore Georgia
  Thompson's ranking data?  Perhaps we don't even need it, because we
  could do everything useful with points and edges along, but it's
  something to think about.

<data name="polygon nodes">
<description>
  The points that define the nodes of the polygons.  Let's suppose
  these are 3d polygons and there are no additional variables on the
  nodes.  These points are required to have ids.

<!-- the polygon data, using the points from the preceding data element -->

<polygondata name="Assorted polygons">
<description>
  The polygons themselves, using the ids defined in the
  preceding data element. 

  The polypoints element is null.  As a result, the default for
  drawing the polygons is this:  they will be drawn using the first
  two variables of the first datad.  Other variables can be specified.

  I was going to say that other datad's can be specified, but that
  isn't really true because id's are unique within a single xml file,
  so the points can only be specified in one datad.

  Let's suppose we have no variables on the polygons, though
  we could have.
