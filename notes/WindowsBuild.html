<h1>Building GGobi on Windows from Source</h1>

This document attempts to explain how to build GGobi (>= 2.0) for Windows. It 
assumes that the reader is reasonably familiar with building packages in linux.

<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>Required tools and libraries:</h3> To quickly obtain the necessary
elements for building GGobi on Windows, get the GGobiWindowsDevPack. It has
everything that is required, and it should be kept up to date.

<h3>MinGW:</h3> The tools we use to build the GGobi distribution depend
on having the <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW/MSYS tools</a>
installed (from the pack).  MinGW is Minimalist GNU for Windows, 
essentially gcc for Windows. MSYS is a build environment for MinGW. For MinGW, 
there are options within the installation that allow you to customize which 
packages are installed (this can also be done after the initial installation). 
Be sure that you include the gcc-core and g77 (if you want to build Rggobi) 
packages. You may also want the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/msysDTK-1.0.1.exe?download">MSYS DTK</a> 
for tools like autoconf. If you plan to build R packages, make sure that you do 
not install Perl from this package, because it conflicts with R's build system,
which requires ActivePerl. Go ahead and install MinGW and MSYS now.

<h3>Setting up the build directories:</h3> Unzip the build.zip file in the pack.
This file assumes you unzipped it to the root directory of your <code>C:</code> drive.
The zip file contains all the necessary libraries and other necessities and creates
a nice UNIXish directory structure.

<h3>Getting the latest ggobi.tar.gz:</h3> You can go to the <a
href="http://www.ggobi.org/Download"> ggobi web site </a> and download
the latest version of the tar.gz file. Place it in <code>/c/build/src</code>.
Start MSYS, change to <code>/c/build/src</code> and untar the archive.

<h3>Path setup:</h3>
Add <code>/c/build/bin</code> to your PATH variable.

<h2>Compilation:</h2> Change to <code>/c/build/src/ggobi</code>. Type
<code>./configure --enable-local</code> and then <code>make</code>.

<P>If you have trouble send an <a href="mailto:ggobi-help@ggobi.org">email</a>, 
complete with the error messages you got in the MSYS window. We'll aim to help as
possible.

<h2>Building the Self-installing Executable</h2>

<h3>Inno Installer</h3>
To create the self-installing GGobi executable, you will need to
<a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/">download</a> Inno. Make sure that
<code>iscc.exe</code> (the Inno compiler) is on your path.

<p>Run <code>make win32-installer</code> to build the setup executable.

<h2>Plugins:</h2>

You should be able to simply do a <code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code> 
in the plugin directory. You can also make plugins using the ggobi build system.
Note that some of the plugins require additional libraries.

<P> The next step is to edit the ggobirc file, and put it in a
location that ggobi will look at so that the plugin will be loaded.

<h1>Building RGGobi on Windows:</h1>

<p>Follow the instructions for building ggobi on Windows in the ggobi
distribution files. You'll at least need the same development
environment.

<h2>Obtain necessary files</h2>
<a href="http://www.ggobi.org/Download">Download</a> the latest Rggobi and 
unpack it into <code>/c/build/src</code>.

<p>The R build system requires <a href="http://www.activestate.com/store/languages/register.plex?id=ActivePerl">ActivePerl</a>.
Make sure it (<code>/c/perl</code>) is on your path.
<p>In order to build Windows help for the documentation, you need <code>hhc.exe</code>
from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp">HTML Help Workshop</a>
on your path. Yes, I know it's from Microsoft, but you need it.

<h2>Build the binary R package</h2>
Enter the <code>Rggobi2</code> directory and run <code>./configure</code>.
<p>Now you have to hack the <code>build</code> perl script in the <code>R/bin</code>
directory so that it doesn't prefix <code>cygwin</code> to paths when running tar.
<p>Finally, make sure R is on your path, and in the parent directory, run:
<PRE>
  Rcmd build --binary Rggobi2
</PRE>

<h2>Installing the package</h2>

Install the Rggobi package using the R menu for installing packages.

<P>You should be ready to start it up:

<PRE>
> library(Rggobi)
> ggobi()
</PRE>
