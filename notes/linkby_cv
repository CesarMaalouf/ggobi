When linking by a categorical variable, here's the process

For now, we'll do the testing and initialize the linkvar_arrays
(like xgobi's rgroups) whenever the mouse goes down.  This is
not ideal, because it might cause a noticeable pause at this point,
but it'll do until we redesign the interface.

Every time the the mouse goes down:

  if (linkby == BR_LINKBYVAR) {
    get the currently selected variable
    if (no variable selected || selected variable is not categorical)
      do nothing;
    else {
      if this is not the current gg->link_variable {
        gg->linkvar_name = the name of this variable
        linkvar_arrays_init (gg->linkvar_name, d, gg);
      }
    }
    brush as usual
