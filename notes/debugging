run ggobi in the debugger like this:

run --sync --g-fatal-warnings [datafile]

This causes it to break when the first gtk/gdk error occurs,
so the backtrace will be informative.

To go after memory errors:

If you don't have a purify license, and you're on linux, then
try this:

valgrind --workaround-gcc296-bugs=yes ggobi [datafile]
